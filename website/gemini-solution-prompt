let's read the pdf 

analyze each question, and give me a solution and explanation for your solution. 

The returned format should be 
{
    "<problem_id>": {
        "text": "<your solution>",
        "answer": "<your choice>"
    },
    "<problem_id>": ...
}

problem id will be 1 to 25
the solution can have html tag to make the solution rendering nice and clean. you can use any valid html tag, and you can use latex too. latex places you should do it like $\\<your latex>$ so that i can render latex on webpage

important!!! DO NOT add CITE_START

here is a valid example

{
    "1": {
      "text": "<p>The sequence of numbers Lucius is counting forms an arithmetic sequence. The first term is $a_1 = 100$.</p><p>He is counting backward by 7s, so the common difference of the sequence is $d = -7$.</p><p>We need to find the 10th number in this sequence, which corresponds to the 10th term, $a_{10}$. The formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.</p><p>Plugging in the values, we get: $a_{10} = 100 + (10-1)(-7) = 100 + 9(-7) = 100 - 63 = 37$.</p>",
      "answer": "B"
    }
}

this is invalid [cite_start]"text":

do not show thinking. just give me the result

only give me result for problem 1 to 15

let's generate result for problem 16 to 25. still in json format


you got incorrect answer for problem 7 and problem 17. do it again. but only return solution for those two problems. you don't need to redo everything else
return the result in html and latex, and put it in json


paraphrase the solution
you are seeing some insertion_index in the text
they match the insertion items in the insertions map

you can use the alt value in each insertion


you are seeing insertations in the format of <INSERTION_INDEX_<some number>> in the text part
the insertions are in the insertions block. those are latex
paraphrase the text for me. you can still use latex in the paraphrased text
you are seeing insertations in the format of <INSERTION_INDEX_<some number>> in the text part
the insertions are in the insertions block. those are latex
paraphrase the text for me. return the result in original json format. you can still use latex and html tags in the paraphrased text
