The probability of the first case is <INSERTION_INDEX_4> because we need to choose 1 of the 4 slots to be a boy. However, the second case has the same probability because we are choosing 1 of the 4 children to be a girl, so the total probability is <INSERTION_INDEX_5>.</p><p><br/>So out of the four fractions, D is the largest.
