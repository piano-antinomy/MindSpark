We need 4 coins. 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17\u00a2 (too large). 3 nickels = 15\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins.

But the problem asks for which one could NOT be made, implying only one answer. Let me check if I missed any combinations.</p><p>Actually, let me be more systematic. The problem is asking which total value could NOT be the total value of the four coins. Let me check each option:</p><p>A) 15\u00a2: Can we make 15\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins?

This is because given a \"mapped\" square, there are $4$ choices for the vertex that will remain in the first quadrant; but once that point is chosen, there is only $1$ distribution of the other $3$ vertices that will result in a square. So, we want four times the number of squares we can make in the first quadrant grid.</p><p><br/>We divide our counting method into two cases: squares with side length $0$ after mapping (which means all four vertices are in the same position relative to their own grids) and squares with side length $1-4$ after mapping.</p><p><br/>Case 1: There are $25$ such squares of length $0$ (this is equivalent to counting the number of points on the grid). However, in this scenario, all of the vertices have been mapped onto the same point. So instead of $4$ choices for the first quadrant vertex, there is only one. Subsequently there are only $25$ such squares that correspond to them.</p><p><br/>Case 2: Let a square with sides parallel to the axes be known as $A$ squares. These $A$ squares can have side length $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$. However, the number of $A$ squares possible depends on the side length. For example, there is only $1$ possible $A$ square of side length $4$, but $16$ squares of side length $1$. To be exact, there are $(5-s)^2$ possible $A$ squares of side length $s$. So, the total number of $A$ squares is</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>But what about \"tilted\" squares? Notice that \"tilted squares\" can always be inscribed (drawn within) another, bigger square. Let a square inscribed within an $A$ square be called a $B$ square. How many $B$ squares are there? Well, this also depends on the side length. We only want squares whose vertices are lattice points (integer value coordinates), so the number of $B$ squares should increase along with side length. We defined $B$ squares to be inscribed within $A$ squares, so we can say that all $B$ squares have their vertices on the side on an $A$ square. Consider an $A$ square with side length $4$. There are $3$ other lattice points along the side of the $A$ square, not counting the vertices. Therefore, we can say that there are $s-1$ possible $B$ squares for every $A$ square with side length $s$. We can multiply $(s-1)$ times the number of $A$ squares to get the number of $B$ squares. This is </p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>total $B$ squares. But we need to add these two quantities to get the number of squares for Case 2:</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2 + \\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>By distributive property, the expression becomes</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 s(5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>Solving, we get $50$ \"mapped\" squares, both $A$ and $B$. Multiplying this by $4$ to get the corresponding number of \"unmapped\" squares, then adding to get the number of squares for Case 1, we get</p><p><br/>$50*4 + 25 = 225 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{E}}$.</p>"
