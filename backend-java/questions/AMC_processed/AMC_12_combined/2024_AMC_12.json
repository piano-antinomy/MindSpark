Our sum must be a positive number, so that would be invalid! We see that -$30, -20, -15$, and $-10$ are too far negative to allow the sum to be positive.

After $-10$, the next factor of $60$ would be $6$. if $z$ = $-6$, $xy = -10$. This might be positive! Now, if we have $z = -6, y = -1$, and $x = 10, x + y + z = 3$.

Then, the hyperbola's asymptotes would intersect at the origin, and it would be symmetric about the coordinate axes (because it makes a distinction neither between $x$ and $-x$ nor $y$ and $-y$). The coordinate axes are the bisectors of the angles formed by the asymptotes, and the hyperbola is symmetric about them. Thus, because the angles formed by our hyperbola's asymptotes are bisected by $y=x$, our hyperbola must be symmetric about $y=x$.</p><p>Thus, with the conditions that $a=-d$ and $c\\neq 0$, there are $11\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 1=1210$ possibilites for $(a,b,c,d)$.

        "<p>Proceed the same way as the other solutions keeping in mind that ${y = y^{-1}}$. Then, I got:$\\frac{(b - dx)}{(cx - a)} = \\frac{(ax + b)}{(cx + d)}$. Cross multiplying and matching coefficients, we get:${-cd(x^{2})}$ = ${ac(x^{2})}$; ${bd}$ = ${-ab}$; and ${-x(d^{2})}$ = ${-x(a^{2})}$. Then, I broke it up into 4 cases:</p><p>Case 1: ${b \\neq 0}$, ${c = 0}$, ${a = -d}$. </p><p>Case 2: ${b = 0}$, ${c = 0}$, ${a^{2} = d^{2}}$.</p><p>Case 3: ${b \\neq 0}$, ${c \\neq 0}$, ${a = -d}$.</p><p>Case 4: ${b = 0}$, ${c \\neq 0}$, ${a = -d}$.</p><p>I first accounted the total number of cases for everything to work WITHOUT any restrictions. So for Case 1, there would be 10 possibilities for ${b}$ and 11 for the part where ${a = -d}$. So a total of 110 cases. Similarly, in the same fashion, Case 2 would yield 21 cases. Case 3 would yield 1100 cases and Case 4 would bring a total of 110 cases. So, our total possibilities right now is ${110 + 21 + 1100 + 110}$ = ${1341}$. But wait! Notice a lot of these cases would bring the denominator of ${y}$ to be 0 namely ${cx + d}$ to be 0. We don't want this! So we have to subtract out all the cases that bring ${cx + d}$ to be 0. Notice for Case 1, ${c = 0}$ so if ${d = 0}$, we have a bad case. We shall keep track of all the \"bad\" cases. For Case 1, any quadruple that includes ${d = 0}$ is \"bad\". So no restrictions upon ${b}$ since ${a}$ depends upon ${d}$. Therefore, we have 10 bad cases so far remember, ${b \\neq 0}$ for Case 1. </p><p>We now proceed to Case 2. Notice we only have 1 \"bad\" case namely ${a = 0}$. This is because ${a}$ and ${d}$ depend on each other again. </p><p>Now Case 3. This will have quite a bit of \"bad\" cases as ${c \\neq 0}$. Firstly, clearly ${a = 0}$ would again have some overcounting going on so we would have to subtract out 10 again as the value of ${b}$ doesn't matter. Then, we start off with ${c = -5}$. Obviously, then ${d = 5}$ would yield a bad case IF ${x = 1}$. Now we see what happens is ${x = 2}$. Then, the denominator would be ${2c + d}$. For this to be 0, ${2c = -d}$. So all even values of ${d}$ would be considered \"bad\". Thus, we would have ${d = -2, -4, 2, 4}$ to be \"bad\" cases which yields a subtotal of 4 cases. Now, the same thing would happen if ${x = 3}$ except all multiples of 3 would be considered \"bad\". So ${d = -3, 3}$ would be \"bad\" or a subtotal of 2 cases. Then, we see the pattern. Multiples of 4 could also be eliminated for ${x = 4}$ which would yield ${d = -4, 4}$ but these overcount the multiples of 2 so no need to worry about them. Lastly, multiples of 5 wouldn't work if ${x = 5}$ so ${d = -5, 5}$ is \"bad\" or 2 cases. Then, ${d = -1, 1}$ could also be eliminated. Then, at last ${d = 0}$ would also not work. Finally, a total of ${10 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1}$ cases would be \"bad\" which yields a subtotal of 19 cases. As you would see, Case 4 has the exact same restrictions on ${c}$ but not ${b}$. So we can predict it would yield the same number of \"bad\" cases as Case 3. Finally, we could add up all of the \"bad\" cases we have:${10 + 1 + 19 + 19}$ = ${49}$ \"bad\" cases. What we did here is also known as counting up all the \"asymptotes\". </p><p>Our answer should be ${1341 - 49 = 1292}$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1292}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"

        "<p>Assign ZA as $x$, then AY as $4 - x$. Assign XM as $y$ and MY as $8 - y$. Since triangles WXM and WZA are equal in area, we can say $4x = 8y$, so $y = 2x$.

We don't factor it yet - we are going to find $x$ again using the Pythagorean Theorem. Similarly, finding MA is just the square root of the squares of AY and MY individually, or $\\sqrt{(8 - 2x)^2 + (4 - x)^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 32x + 4x^2 + 16 - 8x + x^2} = \\sqrt{5x^2 - 40x + 80}$.

        "<p>The sum of the six existing numbers is $24.8$. For the mean to be an integer, the sum of the remaining three numbers $x,y,z$ and the remaining six must be divisible by $9$; thus $x+y+z$ must equal either $2.2,11.2,20.2$. However, one of $x,y,z$ must be the median since the middle four numbers in the original set are all non-integral. As a result, we can eliminate $2.2$ since the sum would be too small to allow for one of $x,y,z$ to be the median (notice that negative numbers are not permitted since the range would be greater than $7$). This leaves two cases.</p><p>For the $x+y+z=20.2$ case, notice that all three must be less than or equal to $8$ due to the range restriction. However, also notice that $y$ and $z$ must be on the higher end of the range, meaning that the new median would have to fall between the new middle numbers $5.2$ and $6.2$. Thus $x=6$, and we can manipulate the numbers to make the range $7$ by making $z=8$ and thus $y=6.2$, providing one case in $(6,6.2,8)$.</p><p>For the $x+y+z=11.2$ case, we note that the average of the three would fall near the median, signaling that one of the numbers would be the median, one would fall lesser than the median, and one would reach greater than the median. Thus we let the median be $y$. Since adding a number to each side of the set would not change the median, we know that the median must fall between the two middle numbers $3.2,5.2$. Then we find two triples $(0.1,4,7.1)$ and $(0,5,6.2)$, resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}$.</p><p>~eevee9406</p>",
        "<p>We can start doing casework on the numbers. Notice that the median can either be four, five or six because there has to be one or two numbers on one side. We can start bashing everything out, starting from letting $x=a, y=4, z=7+a$. Now plugging into the sequence, we get that $a, 1, 2.2, 3.2, 4, 5.2, 6.2, 7, 7+a$. Notice that the sum of the numbers (not including $x, y, z$ is $24.8$. To make this mean an integer, $x+y+z$ must have a decimal $0.2$ when added up. Now, plugging in our values into the mean gets us $35.8+2a=9k$ for some integer $k$. Notice that $0\\leq a\\leq 1$, so the only value for $a$ is $0.1$, so we found our first ordered triplet, $(0.1, 4, 7.1)$. Let\u2019s make the median $5$ now. Then we have to put $x$ and one side and $z$ on the other to \u201cbalance\u201d the numbers, or make it so that there are 4 numbers on each side of $5$. Now, we can see that $x$ is $0$, and solving for $z$, we get that $z=6.2$. We get our second triple is $(0, 5, 6.2)$. Now coming to our third case scenario, we use $6$ as the median. Clearly it means that $x$ has to be the median, so that $y$ and $z$ can be on the same side as $x$. \\[1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.2, 6, 6.2, y, 7, z\\] We will use this diagram.

        "<p>It is easiest to do casework on the range.

As we'll see, the problem will become simpler this way. Since we want integer mean, first note the sum of the values given to be $24.8$: when we add $x,y,z$, it must be a multiple of $9$ to yield an integer mean. Also remember that the median of an increasing list of $9$ numbers is the fifth number.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 1:}$</p><p>Since $x<1$, $z<7$, $x$ must be the minimum of this list of numbers and $7$ is the max: so the range is $7-x$. This must be equal to $7$, so $x=0$. Now we try to make the median an integer.With $x=0$, the fifth smallest number currently is $5.2$, which is clearly not an integer. But if we stick $y$ or $z$ in between $3.2$ and $5.2$, then the median will be an integer. So let one of $y,z$ be $4$: then the sum of all the numbers we have so far is $28.8$. To make this a multiple of $9$, the last number has to be $7.2$ to add up to $36$. However, we said that $z<7$, so this violates the bounds of this case. So then we set $y=5$, so our sum is $29.9$: then $z=36-29.9 = 6.2$. Here everything checks out, so for this case there is one solution: $(0,5,6.2)$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 2:}$</p><p>Since $x>1$ and $z<7$, the minimum is $1$ and the maximum is $7$. Thus the range is always $6$, but we need the range to be $7$, so this case has no solutions.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 3:}$</p><p>We have $x<1, z>7$. Our minimum is $x$ and our maximum is $z$, so the range is $z-x = 7$. Since $x<1$, the median still falls on $5.2$, so $y$ can be either $4$ or $5$ to make the median an integer. For now, suppose $y=4$. Our sum is now $28.8+x+z$, which we set to the nearest multiple of $9:$ $36$. Thus $x+z = 7.2$. Now we have a system of equations: we add them to get $2z = 14.2 \\implies z = 7.1 \\implies x = 0.1$. Since the values of $z$ and $x$ satisfy our case, this is a possible solution.</p><p>Now suppose $y=5$. Our sum is $29.8+x+z$, which must be equal to $36$, so $x+z = 6.2$. Adding the equations, we have $2z = 13.2 \\implies z = 6.6$. But this violates our assumption that $z>7$, so this has no solutions.</p><p>Therefore this case has one solution: $(0.1,4,7.1)$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 4:}$</p><p>Since $x>1, z>7$, the max is $z$ and the min is $1$. Thus $z-1 = 7 \\implies z = 8$. Now the median is between $5.2$ and $6.2$, so $x$ or $y$ must take the value $6$. Our sum is now $24.8+6+8 = 38.8$, and adding the last number has to equal $45$. Thus the last number is $6.2$, and this yields one solution: $(6,6.2,8)$.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/>Therefore we've found three solutions.

        "<p>Firstly, I interpreted the problem algebraically. In other words, let ${x}$ be an integer. Since we're raising it to the ${100}$th power and ${100}$ is even, we don't have to worry about negative values of ${x}$. Now, we break ${125}$ into three factors of ${5}$. I first considered this when we're dividing by ${5}$. Okay so we can write the problem as below:</p><p>$x^{100}\\equiv r \\bmod{5}$. Now, in the world of mod(5), everything is much easier to figure out. Take $x\\equiv 0 \\bmod{5}$. Now, obviously $x^{100}$ will bring up a remainder of ${0}$ if ${x}$ itself is a multiple of 5. Now, $x\\equiv 1 \\bmod{5}$. In this case, notice how $1^{100}$ is congruent to 1 in the mod(5) world. So in this case, we would have a remainder of 1. Considering $x\\equiv 2 \\bmod{5}$, it's a little more tricky. Notice $2^{100}$ is equal to $1024^{10}$ and ${1024}$ is 1 less than a multiple of 5. So ${1024}$ will be congruent to $-1 \\bmod{5}$ and raising it to the power of 10 will bring up a remainder of 1 yet again. Similarly, is $x\\equiv 3 \\bmod{5}$ or $x\\equiv 4 \\bmod{5}$, you would notice both these cases will bring up a remainder of 1 again. So in the mod(5) world, we seem to only have remainders of ${0}$ and ${1}$. Interesting!Therefore, since ${125}$ is just ${3}$ factors of ${5}$, we may say that in mod(125), we would have the same exact remainders namely ${0}$ and ${1}$. Therefore, we would only have ${2}$ possible remainders. This brings an answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\; 2}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"

        "<p>By letting BC equal ${2a}$, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area. Notice the semi-perimeter is just$\\frac{40 + 42 + 2a}{2}$ which is just ${a + 41}$. Next, by Heron's formula, the area of ABC is:$\\sqrt{(a + 41)(a + 1)(a - 1)(41 - a)}$ which simplifies to the$\\sqrt{(a^2 - 1)(41^2 - a^2)}$.We now know that the domain of ${f(x)}$ is just the domain of $\\sqrt{(a^2 - 1)(41^2 - a^2)}$. This domain is very easy to calculate. We see that $a^{2} >$1 and$a^{2} <$$41^{2}$.Because ${a}$ is always positive, we see that ${a}$ is in the open interval ${(1, 41)}$. Now, we find the maximum of ${f(x)}$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:$\\frac{((a^2 - 1) + (41^2 - a^2))}{2}$ \u2265 $\\sqrt{(a^2 - 1)(41^2 - a^2)}$. Simplifying and letting$\\sqrt{(a^2 - 1)(41^2 - a^2)}$ = ${f(x)}$, we get that ${f(x)}$ \u2264 $\\frac{41^2 - 1}{2}$ = ${840}$. We know by AM-GM that${f(x)}$ = ${840}$ if and only if $a^{2} -$1 = $41^{2}  -$$a^{2}$. Solving, ${a}$ = ${29}$. Therefore, we have found the domain of ${f}$ is the open interval ${(1, 41)}$ and the maximum of ${f}$ is ${840}$ which occurs at ${x}$ = ${29}$(Apply Stewart's to triangle ABC when knowing that BC = ${58}$.) Adding these up, we get ${1 + 41 + 840 + 29}$ = ${911}$ or $\\boxed{C}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"
