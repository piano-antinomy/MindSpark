On the other hand, since there are fewer $29$'s, $30$'s, and $31$'s than the rest of the numbers, the mean has to be lower than $16$ (the median).

        "<p>Any valid sequence must start with a $0$. We can then think of constructing a sequence as adding groups of terms to this $0$, each ending in $0$.

We may finish with the methods in the solutions above.</p><p>~ numberwhiz</p><p>While the solutions above have attempted the problem in general, knowing the fact that $\\triangle ABD$ is equilateral greatly reduces the effort to find the final answer, hence I propose an alternative after this.</p><p>Let $AB = BD = AD = x$ and $\\angle BCD = \\theta$. By cosine rule on $\\triangle BCD$ :\\[x^2 = 40 - 24\\cos \\theta\\]Thus, the total area of the quadrilateral is supposedly :\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(x^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(2)(6)\\sin \\theta\\]\\[\\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(40 - 24\\cos \\theta) + 6\\sin \\theta\\]\\[\\implies 6(\\sin \\theta - \\sqrt{3}\\cos \\theta) + 10\\sqrt{3} \\geq 12 + 10\\sqrt{3}\\]Where the inequality comes from a common trigonometric identity, $(\\sin \\theta - \\sqrt{3}\\cos \\theta) \\geq \\sqrt{1^2 + \\big(\\sqrt{3}\\big)^2} = 2.$</p><p>~ SouradipClash_03</p>",
