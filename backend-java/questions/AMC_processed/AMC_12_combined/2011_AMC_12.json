Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of $d$ on the way there, and again cover a distance of $d$ on when drawing closer. This makes sense, because from the 1st diagram to the second, the raft moves in the same direction as the boat, while from the 2nd to the 3rd, the boat and raft move in opposite directions.</p><p>Let $b$ denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and $r$ denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from $A$ to $B$, the boat travels at a velocity of $b+r$, and on the way back, travels at a velocity of $-(b-r)=r-b$, since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from $A$ to $B$ becomes $(r+b)-r=b$, and on the way back it becomes $(r-b)-r=-b$. Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, $b$ and $-b$, we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other.</p><p>From this, we have that the boat travels a distance $d$ at rate $b$ with respect to the raft both on the way to $B$ and on the way back. Thus, using $\\dfrac{distance}{speed}=time$, we have $\\dfrac{2d}{b}=9\\text{ hours}$, and to see how long it took to travel half the distance, we have $\\dfrac{d}{b}=4.5\\text{ hours}\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$</p>",

Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point.

        "<p>This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$. Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$. Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$, and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$. If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$. Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$, we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$, is indeed equal to $\\frac{P_1}{2}$. Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \\frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$, $P_n = \\frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$. Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$, we get that $P_n = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$. If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us:First Sequence:$x_1 < 2012$</p><p>$x_2 < 2013$</p><p>$x_3 < 2011$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is:$x_1 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$</p><p>$x_2 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$</p><p>$x_3 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$. Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when:$2^{n-2} < 503$(You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$. If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$, we see that $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$(and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\\boxed{D}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"

Starting from any point on the border, the farthest that it can go is 5 units in some cardinal direction, which gives us the tiled region in the diagram above. Finally, from our corners, we can also go 4-1, 3-2, 2,3, or 1-4, which gives us the rest of the region enclosed in blue. This gives us our octagon. </p><p>tl;dr the interior of the octagon in blue is a result of taking all the points that can be reached from the boundary of the box as described in no more than 5 moves.
