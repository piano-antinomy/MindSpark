The square root of a positive number is a positive number, and the square root of a negative or complex number will yield a complex number. Complex numbers are a bit harder to address than real numbers, so I won't go into depth on complex domain/range (You don't need to, as this is a 2003 question, and the test writers most likely did not intend for test takers to take complex numbers into consideration. Also, even without considering complex domain/range, we can still get the answer).</p><p>Since the range cannot include negative numbers, the domain must be the same. This means that the graph of $f(x)$ must only exist in the real coordinate plane for non-negative x-values.

If we take the square root of such a parabola, the new function will exist only from $x=[-\\infty, r_1]$ and $x=[r_2, \\infty]$. In order words, if $a$ is positive, the graph of $f(x)$ will exist from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ except between the two roots. This means, that regardless of where the roots are, some negative value of $x$ will yield a positive value of $f(x)$. This means a positive value of $a$ will not work.</p><p>Now we consider the case where $a$ is negative. The parabola will do the opposite of the above; i.e. extend downwards. Now, either the entire graph of the parabola is below the x-axis (no roots), or some part including the vertex sticks out above it. The graph of the square root of the parabola will either be non-existent, or exist only between the 2 roots, respectively. This could work, as long as both roots are at least 0 (this way we will not have negative x-values in the domain). </p><p>Upon examination, we find that $ax^2+bx$ can be rewritten $x(ax+b)$. The roots are then $x=0$ and $x=-\\frac{b}{a}$. Since $a$ is negative, and $b$ is positive, $-\\frac{b}{a}$ will always be positive. Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ will only exist from $x=\\left[0, -\\frac{b}{a}\\right]$ (the domain).</p><p>Notice that $ax^2+bx$ can also be written in vertex form. The maximum value of $f(x)$ (since $a$ is negative) is the y-coordinate of the vertex, i.e. the range of $f(x)$ is $[0, \\text{vertex}]$. Converting $ax^2+bx$ to vertex form yields $f(x) = a\\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4a}$. The y-coordinate of the vertex is then $-\\frac{b^2}{4a}$. We want the square root of this, so the range of $f(x)$ is $\\left[0, \\sqrt{-\\frac{b^2}{4a}}\\right]$. Since domain and range must be equivalent, we have $\\frac{b}{-a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{-4a}} \\Rightarrow \\frac{b}{-a} = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{-4a}} \\Rightarrow -a = \\sqrt{-4a} \\Rightarrow a^2 = -4a \\Rightarrow a^2 + 4a = 0 \\Rightarrow a(a+4) = 0$. So we have $a= 0, -4$, which is 2 values or $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C)}}$</p>"

Together with the fact that $(b,c-a)$ is on $f(x)$, we see that $P=(a,c-a+b-a)$.
