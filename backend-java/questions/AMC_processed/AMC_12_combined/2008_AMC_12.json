        "<p>This solution might be time consuming, but it is pretty rigorous. Also, throughout the solution refer to the graph in solution 1 to understand this one more. Lets first start off by defining the position function for Michael. We let $M(t) = 5t$, where $t$ is the amount of seconds passed. Now, lets define the position function of the truck as two independent functions. It is obvious, graphically, that the position function of the truck is a piecewise function alternating between linear lines and constant lines. Lets focus on the linear pieces of the truck's position function. Let the $kth$ linear part of the truck's position function be denoted as $L_k(t)$. Then through algebra, it is found that $L_k(t) = 10t +  500 - 300k$, ${50k - 50 <= t <= 50k - 30}$. Now, lets move on to the constant pieces, which is a lot easier in terms of algebra. Let the $ith$ constant part of the truck's position function be denoted as $C_i(t)$. Then, again, through algebra we obtain $C_i(t) = 200 * (i + 1)$, ${50i - 30 <= t <= 50i}$. Now, let me stress that $i$ and $k$ are disjoint, which is why I used different variable names. We are interested in where $C_i(t)$ and $L_k(t)$ intersect $M(t)$ or $5t$. $L_k(t)$ intersects $M$ at $(60k - 100, 300k - 500)$. However, the only $k$ values that actually work are $5 <= k <= 7$ because of the domain restrictions on $L_k(t)$. Similarly, we also see that for $C_i(t)$ it intersects at $(40i + 40, 200i + 200)$. The only $i$ values that work is $4 <= i <= 7$. However, some pair $(i, k)$ might yield the same exact intersection point. Checking this through simple algebra we see that $(4,5)$ and $(7,7)$ do indeed yield the same intersection point. Thus, our answer is $(7 - 5 + 1) + (7 - 4 + 1) - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.</p><p>Note: This is probably not the best solution as it seems a lot more tedious, but it still works. I admit this solution isn't elegant at all.</p><p>~triggod</p>"

The circles are tangent when the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Thus, the distance from $A$ to $B$ will be $2$. Since $A$ and $B$ are separated by $1$ vertically, they must be separated by $\\sqrt{3}$ horizontally. Thus, if $|A_x-B_x|<\\sqrt{3}$, the circles intersect.</p><p>Now, plot the two random variables $A_x$ and $B_x$ on the coordinate plane. Each variable ranges from $0$ to $2$. The circles intersect if the variables are within $\\sqrt{3}$ of each other. Thus, the area in which the circles don't intersect is equal to the total area of two small triangles on opposite corners, each of area $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{2}$. So, the total area of the 2 triangles sums to $(2-\\sqrt{3})^2$. Since the total $2 \\times 2$ square has an area of $4$, the probability of the circles not intersecting is $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{4}$. But remember, we want the probability that they do intersect.

The probability that $B_X$ falls within the desired range for a given $A_X$ is $A_X$ (on the left) $+\\sqrt{3}$ (on the right) all over $2$ (the range of possible values). The total probability for this range is the sum of all these probabilities of $B_X$ (over the range of $A_X$) divided by the total range of $A_X$ (which is $2$). Thus, the total probability for this interval is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_{0}^{2-\\sqrt{3}} \\frac{x+\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\,dx\\right) =\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x^2/4+\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\Big |_{0}^{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\] \\[= \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{4-4\\sqrt{3}+3}{4} + \\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3}{2}) =\\frac{1}{8}.\\]2) $A_X$ is on the interval $(2-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$.

        "<p>We first calculate the probability that the circles at are their maximum possible distance while still intersecting. Since the difference in heights is 1, and the two radii add up to 2 (at their point of tangency), we can see that the maximum possible distance for the two centers is $\\sqrt3$. If we look at possible placements for the lower point, we see that at placement $(0,0)$ there is exactly $\\sqrt3$ of space wherein we can put the top point. Similarly, at point $(1,0)$ we can put the top point anywhere, resulting in $2$ of space. If one looks at a diagram (which I can't put here), we can see that the space available for the top point increases linearly from $(0,0)$ to $(2-\\sqrt3,0)$. From then on to $(1,0)$ it stops at $2$ (this is symmetric for the other half of placements). If one draws a plot of the space available (which I again can't show here) with x determined by the x-value of the bottom point and y determined by space available for the top point, we notice two things: first, since for each (theoretically infinitesimally) small x-slice there is a line segment determining how much space there is available, if we sum up all of the line segments and divide by the total space (technically speaking by enumerating all the valid combinations and dividing by all of the general combinations), we will end up with a plot that looks like a rectangle with two small triangles cut out of it. Two, that since this is symmetric, we can just focus on the first half as the ratio of valid to total is the same. We see that the rectangle has a height of $2$ and a width of $1$, thus its area is 2. The triangle's height is $2-\\sqrt3$, and its width is the same thus its area is $(2-\\sqrt3)^2/2$ => $(7-4\\sqrt3)/2$. Now we simply subtract to obtain $(4\\sqrt3-3)/2$ is the valid area, thus $(4\\sqrt3-3)/4 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{E}$ is our solution.</p>"

Setting this equal to $\\sqrt{x}$ and solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{4}{3}$, so $B_2 = (\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3})$. By equilateral triangle properties, we have that $A_2 = (2, 0)$. Repeating this process, we find that $B_3 = (3, \\sqrt{3})$ and $A_3 = (4,0)$. At this point, we notice that the $y$-coordinate of each $B_i$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ more than that of $B_{i-1}$, so $B_4 = (\\frac{16}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3})$ and $A_4 = (\\frac{20}{3}, 0)$. It may be helpful to continue calculating out the $A_i$ and $B_i$ if the pattern in the $x$-coordinates of the $A_i$ isn't visible yet. At this point, it can be noticed that the differences between the x coordinates of consecutive $A_i$ form an arithmetic sequence ($x_{A_1} - x_{A_0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, $x_{A_2} - x_{A_1} = \\frac{4}{3}$, etc.). Additionally, the numerator of each of the fractions is a consecutive even number, and the sum of the first $n$ even numbers is $n(n+1)$. Thus, we must find the least integral solution to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{3} \\geq 100$. This least solution is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}~17}$.</p><p>~ <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cxsmi\" rel=\"nofollow\">cxsmi</a></p>"
