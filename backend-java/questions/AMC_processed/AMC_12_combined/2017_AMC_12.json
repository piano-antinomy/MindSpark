        "<p>It is possible to solve this problem using elementary counting methods. This solution proceeds by a cleaner generating function.</p><p>We note that $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$ both lie on the imaginary axis and each of the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(\\pm 1\\pm i)$ have length $\\frac{1}{2}$ and angle of odd multiples of $\\pi/4$, i.e. $\\pi/4,3\\pi/4,5\\pi/4,7\\pi/4$. When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is $6^{12}$. Now we count the number of good combinations.</p><p>We first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have $n$ of the numbers $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$; then we must have $\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12-n}=1 \\Longrightarrow n=8$. Having $n=8$ will take care of the length of the product; now we need to deal with the angle.</p><p>We require $\\sum\\theta\\equiv\\pi \\mod 2\\pi$. Letting $z$ be $e^{i\\pi/4}$, we see that the angles we have available are $\\{z^1,z^2,z^3,z^5,z^6,z^7\\}$, where we must choose exactly 8 angles from the set $\\{z^2,z^6\\}$ and exactly 4 from the set $\\{z^1,z^3,z^5,z^7\\}$. If we found a good combination where we had $a_i$ of each angle $z^i$, then the amount this would contribute to our count would be $\\binom{12}{4,8}\\cdot\\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\cdot\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}$. We want to add these all up. We proceed by generating functions.</p><p>Consider \\[(t_2x^2+t_6x^6)^8(t_1x^1+t_3x^3+t_5x^5+t_7x^7)^4.\\] The expansion will be of the form $\\sum_i\\left(\\sum_{\\sum a=i} \\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}{t_1}^{a_1}{t_2}^{a_2}{t_3}^{a_3}{t_5}^{a_5}{t_6}^{a_6}{t_7}^{a_7}x^i \\right)$. Note that if we reduced the powers of $x$ mod $8$ and fished out the coefficient of $x^4$ and plugged in $t_i=1\\ \\forall\\,i$ (and then multiplied by $\\binom{12}{4,8}$) then we would be done. Since plugging in $t_i=1$ doesn't affect the $x$'s, we do that right away. The expression then becomes \\[x^{20}(1+x^4)^8(1+x^2+x^4+x^6)^4=x^{20}(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\] where the last equality is true because we are taking the powers of $x$ mod $8$. Let $[x^n]f(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in $f(x)$. Note $[x^4] x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=[x^0](1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4$. We use the roots of unity filter, which states \\[\\text{terms of }f(x)\\text{ that have exponent congruent to }k\\text{ mod }n=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{f(z^mx)}{z^{mk}},\\] where $z=e^{i\\pi/n}$. In our case $k=0$, so we only need to find the average of the $f(z^mx)$'s.\\begin{align*} z^0 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^1 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^2 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^3 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^4 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^5 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^6 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^7 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4. \\end{align*}We plug in $x=1$ and take the average to find the sum of all coefficients of $x^{\\text{multiple of 8}}$. Plugging in $x=1$ makes all of the above zero except for $z^0$ and $z^4$. Averaging, we get $2^{14}$. Now the answer is simply \\[\\frac{\\binom{12}{4,8}}{6^{12}}\\cdot 2^{14}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}.\\]</p>",

Multiplying the hexagon's vertices by $i$ doesn't change $P$, and switching any $z_j$ with $-z_j$ doesn't change the property $P=\\pm 1$, so the probability that $P=\\pm1$ remains the same if we only select our $z_j$'s at random from\\[\\left\\{a= \\sqrt 2,\\quad b=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\\quad c=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i)\\right\\}.\\]Since $|a|=\\sqrt2$ and $|b|=|c|=\\frac12$, we must choose $a$ exactly $8$ times to make $|P|=1$.

To have $P=-1$, we must have that $|P|=1$, so eight of the $(z_i)$ must belong to \\[\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}\\]and the other four must belong to \\[\\left \\{ \\frac{x}{2},\\frac{x^3}{2},\\frac{x^5}{2},\\frac{x^7}{2} \\right\\}\\]So, we write the generating function \\[\\left (x^2 +x^6 \\right )^8 \\left (x+x^3+x^5+x^7 \\right )^4\\]to describe the product. Note that this assumes that the $(z_i)$ that belong to $\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}$ come first, so we will need to multiply by $\\binom{12}{4}$ at the end.

        "<p>Burnside's Lemma can be applied to the problem. Number the disks 1-6 from top to bottom and left to right. First, we count the number of group actions. There are $6$ in total: $3$ rotations, $0$\u00b0, $120$\u00b0, and $240$\u00b0. Additionally, there are $3$ different reflections, which are over lines passing through the middle of disks $1$, $4$, and $6$. The $0$\u00b0 rotation has the total number of diagrams fixed, which is $6!/3!\\cdot2!=60$. The $120$\u00b0 and $240$\u00b0 rotations each have $0$ fixed diagrams, as one would need the same color for disks $1, 4, 6$ and the same color for disks $2, 3, 5,$ which isn't possible. Consider the reflection over the line passing through disk $1$. The green can be placed in $2$ places, disk $1$ or $5$, and then, the blue must go in either disks $2$ and $3$ or disks $4$ and $6$, so the number of fixed diagrams is $2\\cdot2=4$. The other two reflections also have $4$ unique fixed diagrams. Therefore, applying Burnside's Lemma, we get $(60+4+4+4)/6 = \\boxed{\\bold{(D)}\\, 12}$</p><p>Solution by Aadileo</p>"

      "solutions": [
        "<p>First, remove all the 90s, since they make no impact. So, we have numbers from $1$ to $10$. Then, $5$ is the 7th number. Let the sum of the first $6$ numbers be $k$. Then, $k\\equiv 0 \\mod 6$ and $k\\equiv 3 \\mod 7$. We easily solve this as $k \\equiv 24 \\mod 42$. Clearly, the sum of the first $6$ numbers must be $570$. In order for the first $5$ numbers to sum to a multiple of $5$, the sixth number must also be a multiple of $5$, since $30$ is a multiple of $5$. Thus, the only option is the sixth number is $10$, which gives $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$</p><p>~ firebolt360</p>",
        "<p>Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.</p><p>From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$. </p><p>The average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$.However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)</p><p>Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$.Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.</p>",

Let $m$ be Isabella's average after $5$ tests, and let $a$ be her sixth test score. $5m+a= 6\\cdot95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $a$ is a multiple of $5$. Since $100$ is the only choice that is a multiple of $5$, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $T$ be the total sum of Isabella's first five test scores, and let $S$ be her score on the sixth test. It follows that $T\\equiv 0\\pmod {5}$, $T+S\\equiv 0\\pmod {6}$, and $T+S+95\\equiv 0\\pmod {7}$, since at each step, her average score was an integer. Using the last equivalence, $T+S\\equiv -95\\equiv 3\\pmod{7}$, so we have a system of equivalences for $T+S$. Solving this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get $T+S\\equiv (0)(7)(1)+(3)(6)(-1) \\equiv -18 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{42}$.</p><p>Now let's put a bound on $T$.

However, $95-7=88$ and $95+7=102$ clearly cannot be $a_6$ since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, $a_6$ must be 95. Additionally, $a_5$ cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, $a_5$ should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for $a_5$. Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from $a_5$.

So, on average, there will be \\[\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{9}{5}\\]teams in any group of 9 people. Similarly, on average, there will be\\[\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{8}{5}\\]teams in any group of 8 people. So,\\begin{align*}\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{8}{5}} \\implies&amp; \\binom{9}{5}\\binom{8}{5} T^2 = \\binom{n}{5}^2 \\\\\\implies&amp; 84T = \\binom{n}{5}\\end{align*}Therefore $84 \\mid \\binom{n}{5}$ and proceed as shown in solution 1.</p><p>FYI, to find n such that $32 \\mid n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$ without bashing everything:Clearly $n \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\pmod{32}$ works. Then, do cases.</p><p>Case 1: $4 \\mid n$.This will always work, as $4 \\mid n$, $4 \\mid n-4$, and $2 \\mid n-2$, so $4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 32 \\mid n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$. So, \\[n \\equiv 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 \\pmod{32}\\]are also solutions.</p><p>Case 2: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$Then $n-4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ as well. $n$ and $n-4$ can only contribute one 2 each, since $4 \\nmid n, n-4$. We need a factor of $2^3$ in $n-2$ then. So, $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. Then, we get \\[n \\equiv 2, 10, 18, 26 \\pmod{32}\\].</p><p>Case 3: $4 \\nmid n$We can only get twos from $n-1$ and $n-3$. Note that one of them can only contribute a single factor of 2, because otherwise $4 \\mid n-1$ and $4 \\mid n-3$, so $n$ has a remainder of both 1 and 3 mod 4, which is impossible. So, one must have a factor of 16. We get $n \\equiv 1, 3 \\pmod{16}$ so \\[n \\equiv 1, 3, 17, 19 \\pmod{32}\\]</p><p>In all, we get the solutions\\[n \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28 \\pmod{32}\\]</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Crazyvideogamez\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrazyVideoGamez</a></p>"
