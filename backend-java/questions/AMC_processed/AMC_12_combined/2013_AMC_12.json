The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.</p><p><br/>The area also includes $4$ circular segments.

Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below).

        "<p><br/>Let us dilate triangle $ABC$ so that the sides of equilateral triangle $BXN$ are all equal to $2.$ The purpose of this is to ease the calculations we make in the problem. Given this, we aim to find the length of segment $AM$ so that we can un-dilate triangle $ABC$ by dividing each of its sides by $AM$.

The coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{p + n}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1)\\right)$, and we can plug in these coordinates into the equation of line $BM$, yielding that \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = -\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) + \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = -p - n + 2 \\implies p = -2n + 1.\\] For our second equation, notice that line $AC$ has equation $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}x - \\sqrt{3}$. Midpoint $M$ must also lie on this line, and we can substitute coordinates again to get \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) - \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{p + n}{p} - 2 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{n}{p} - 1\\] \\[\\implies p = \\frac{n}{n + 2}.\\]</p><p>Setting both equations equal to each other and multiplying both sides by $(n + 2)$, we have that $-2n^2 - 4n + n + 2 = n \\implies -2n^2 - 4n + 2 = 0$, which in turn simplifies into $0 = n^2 + 2n - 1$ when dividing the entire equation by $-2.$ Using the quadratic formula, we have that \\[n = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = -1 - \\sqrt{2}.\\] Here, we discard the positive root since $A$ must lie to the left of the y-axis. Then, the coordinates of $C$ are $(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, and the coordinates of $A$ are $(-1 - \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{6}).$ Seeing that segment $AM$ has half the length of side $AC$, we have that the length of $AM$ is \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - (-1 - \\sqrt{2}))^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 24\\sqrt{2} + 18 + 6}}{2} = \\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}.\\]</p><p>Now, we divide each side length of $\\triangle ABC$ by $AM$, and from this, $BN^2$ will equal $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{5+3\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}.}$</p>",
