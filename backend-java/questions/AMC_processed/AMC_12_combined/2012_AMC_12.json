There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares.

Thus, there are $8$ cases.<br/>Case 3: 2 white squares. We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this.<br/>Case 4: 3 white squares.Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case.<br/>Case 5: 4 white squares.Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4.Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions.

It increases linearly with a slope of one, then when it reaches the next integer, it repeats itself. We can deduce that the function is like a sawtooth wave, with a period of one. We then analyze the function $f(x)=|2\\{x\\}-1|$. The slope of the teeth is multiplied by 2 to get 2, and the function is moved one unit downward. The function can then be described as starting at -1, moving upward with a slope of 2 to get to 1, and then repeating itself, still with a period of 1. The absolute value of the function is then taken. This results in all the negative segments becoming flipped in the Y direction. The positive slope starting at -1 of the function ranging from $u$ to $u.5$, where u is any arbitrary integer, is now a negative slope starting at positive 1.  The function now looks like the letter V repeated within every square in the first row. </p><p>It is now that we address the goal of this, which is to determine how many times the function intersects the line $y=x$. Since there are two line segments per box, the function has two chances to intersect the line $y=x$ for every integer. If the height of the function is higher than $y=x$ for every integer on an interval, then every chance within that interval intersects the line. </p><p>Returning to analyzing the function, we note that it is multiplied by $x$, and then fed into $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is a periodic function, we can model it as multiplying the function's frequency by $x$. This gives us $2x$ chances for every integer, which is then multiplied by 2 once more to get $4x$ chances for every integer. The amplitude of this function is initially 1, and then it is multiplied by $n$, to give an amplitude of $n$. The function intersects the line $y=x$ for every chance in the interval of $0\\leq x \\leq n$, since the function is n units high. The function ceases to intersect $y=x$ when $n < x$, since the height of the function is lower than $y=x$. </p><p>The number of times the function intersects $y=x$ is then therefore equal to $4+8+12...+4n$.

Here, we have three choices for food on Thursday and Saturday since cake must be served on Friday, and none of these choices are cake, which was served Wednesday. Likewise, we have three choices (pie, ice cream, and pudding) for the food served on Tuesday and thus three choices for those served on Monday and Sunday, with these three choices being whatever was not served on Tuesday and Monday, respectively.

However, since one of those foods was chosen for Wednesday, we only have two possibilities for Thursday's food.

Since every meal plan is counted by the summation of the $4$ aforementioned plans (note that Friday's dessert has to be one of the $4$ given desserts) and that these cases are mutually exclusive (i.e. you cannot make both a cake and pudding on Friday), each case results in a quarter of the total meal plans (Since there are $4$ desserts, we multiply by $\\tfrac{1}{4}$). The total number of plans with no restrictions can be counted with constructive counting, as follows:</p><p>We note that there are $4$ ways to choose the first dessert.

        "<p>She walks at a rate of $x$ units per second to travel a distance $y$. As $vt=d$, we find $60x=y$ and $24*(x+k)=y$, where $k$ is the speed of the escalator. Setting the two equations equal to each other, $60x=24x+24k$, which means that $k=1.5x$. Now we divide $60$ by $1.5$ because you add the speed of the escalator but remove the walking, leaving the final answer that it takes to ride the escalator alone as $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 40}$</p>",
        "<p>We write two equations using distance = rate * time. Let $r$ be the rate she is walking, and $e$ be the speed the escalator moves. WLOG, let the distance of the escalator be $120$, as the distance is constant. Thus, our $2$ equations are $120 = 60r$ and $120 = 24(r+e)$. Solving for $e$, we get $e = 3$. Thus, it will take Clea $\\dfrac{120}{3} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 40}$ seconds.</p><p>~coolmath2017~Extremelysupercooldude (Latex edits)</p>",

        "<p>First, we think of ways to make all the $1$'s consecutive. If there are no consecutive $1$'s, there are $\\binom{20}{0}$ ways to order them. If there is one consecutive $1$, there are $\\binom{20}{1}$ ways to order them. If there are two consecutive $1$'s, then there are $\\binom{19}{1}$ ways to order them (We treat the two $1$'s like a block, and then order that block with 18 other $0$'s). Continuing in this fashion, there are $\\binom{20}{0} + \\binom{20}{1} + \\binom{19}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{1}{1} = 1 + 20 + 19 + \\cdots + 2 + 1 = 210 + 1 = 211$ ways to order consecutive $1$'s. From symmetry, there are also $211$ ways to order the $0$'s. Now, from PIE, we subtract out the cases where both the $1$'s and the $0$'s are consecutive. We do this because when counting the ways to order the $1$'s, we counted all of these cases once. Then, we did so again when ordering the $0$'s. So, to only have all of these cases once, we must subtract them. If $1$ is the leftmost digit, then there are $20$ cases where all the $1$'s and $0$'s are consecutive (we basically are choosing how many $1$'s are consecutive, and there are $20$ possibilities. All other digits become $0$, which are automatically consecutive since the $1$'s are consecutive. There are also $20$ cases when $0$ is the left-most digit. Thus, there are a total of $211 + 211 - 20 - 20 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 382}$. But, from the way the problem is worded, it somewhat implies that the orderings must include both $1$'s and $0$'s, so the answer would then be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 380}$ after we subtract out the cases where the orderings are either all $1$'s or all $0$'s.

Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ go through $SP$ and $RQ$, respectively, and $SP$ and $RQ$ are opposite sides of the square, we can say that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel with slope $m$. Similarly, $L_3$ and $L_4$ have slope $-\\frac{1}{m}$. Also, note that since square $PQRS$ lies in the first quadrant, $L_1$ and $L_2$ must have a positive slope.

Intersecting the two equations, the $y$-coordinate of point $R$ is found to be $y = \\frac{8m}{m^2 + 1}$. Subtracting the two, we get $\\Delta y = \\frac{6m}{m^2 + 1}$.

The equation of the line going through $(4,0)$ is given by $y = 3(x-4)$ and the equation of the line going through $(10,0)$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x-10)$.

Since these 2 lines are parallel to the sides of the square, they are perpendicular (since the sides of a square are). Let $m$ be the slope of the first line. Then $-\\frac{1}{m}$ is the slope of the second line. We may use the point-slope form for the equation of a line to write $l_1:y=m(x-4)$ and $l_2:y=-\\frac{1}{m}(x-10)$. We easily calculate the intersection of these lines using substitution or elimination to obtain $\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)$ as the center or the square.

        "<p>Since $z_0$ is a root of $P$, and $P$ has integer coefficients, $z_0$ must be algebraic. Since $z_0$ is algebraic and lies on the unit circle, $z_0$ must be a root of unity (Comment: this is not true. See this link: <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4323/are-all-algebraic-integers-with-absolute-value-1-roots-of-unity\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>). Since $P$ has degree 4, it seems reasonable (and we will assume this only temporarily) that $z_0$ must be a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th root of unity. These are among the set $\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,(-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3})/2\\}$. Since complex roots of polynomials come in conjugate pairs, we have that $P$ has one (or more) of the following factors: $z+1$, $z-1$, $z^2+1$, or $z^2+z+1$. If $z=1$ then $a+b+c+d+4=0$; a contradiction since $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative. On the other hand, suppose $z=-1$. Then $(a+c)-(b+d)=4$. This implies $a+b=8,7,6,5,4$ while $b+d=4,3,2,1,0$ correspondingly. After listing cases, the only such valid $a,b,c,d$ are $4,4,4,0$, $4,3,3,0$, $4,2,2,0$, $4,1,1,0$, and $4,0,0,0$. </p><p>Now suppose $z=i$. Then $4=(a-c)i+(b-d)$ whereupon $a=c$ and $b-d=4$. But then $a=b=c$ and $d=a-4$. This gives only the cases $a,b,c,d$ equals $4,4,4,0$, which we have already counted in a previous case.</p><p>Suppose $z=-i$. Then $4=i(c-a)+(b-d)$ so that $a=c$ and $b=4+d$. This only gives rise to $a,b,c,d$ equal $4,4,4,0$ which we have previously counted. </p><p>Finally suppose $z^2+z+1$ divides $P$. Using polynomial division ((or that $z^3=1$ to make the same deductions) we ultimately obtain that $b=4+c$. This can only happen if $a,b,c,d$ is $4,4,0,0$. </p><p>Hence we've the polynomials\\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+3x^2+3x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+2x^2+2x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+x^2+x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2\\]However, by inspection $4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x+4$ has roots on the unit circle, because $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ which brings the sum to 92 (choice B). Note that this polynomial has a 5th root of unity as a root. We will show that we were \\textit{almost} correct in our initial assumption; that is that $z_0$ is at most a 5th root of unity, and that the last polynomial we obtained is the last polynomial with the given properties. Suppose that $z_0$ in an $n$th root of unity where $n>5$, and $z_0$ is not a 3rd or 4th root of unity. (Note that 1st and 2nd roots of unity are themselves 4th roots of unity). If $n$ is prime, then \\textit{every} $n$th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial, but since $n>5$ and the degree of our polynomial is 4, this is impossible. Suppose $n$ is composite. If it has a prime factor $p$ greater than 5 then again every $p$th root of unity must satisfy our polynomial and we arrive at the same contradiction. Therefore suppose $n$ is divisible only by 2,3,or 5. Since by hypothesis $z_0$ is not a 2nd or 3rd root of unity, $z_0$ must be a 5th root of unity. Since 5 is prime, every 5th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial. That is, the other 4 complex 5th roots of unity must satisfy $P(z_0)=0$. But $(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ has exactly all 5th roots of unity excluding 1, and $(x^5-1)/(x-1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$. Thus this must divide $P$ which implies $P(x)=4(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$. This completes the proof.</p>",
        "<p>First, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $z_0=1$ or $-1$. $1$ does not work because $P(1)\\geq 4$. Assume that $z_0=-1$.

Now $4+b=4+c$ gives $b=c$, therefore the only possible choices for $(a,b,c,d)$ are $(4,t,t,0)$. In these cases, $P(-1)=4-4+t-t+0=0$. The sum of $P(1)$ over these cases is $\\sum_{t=0}^{4} (4+4+t+t) = 40+20=60$.</p><p>Second, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\mathbb{R}$, so $z_0=x_0+iy_0$ for some real $x_0, y_0$, $|x_0|<1$. By conjugate roots theorem we have that $P(z_0)=P(z_0^{*})=0$, therefore $(z-z_0)(z-z_0^{*}) = (z^2 - 2x_0*z + 1)$ is a factor of $P(z)$, and we may assume that </p><p>\\[P(z) = (z^2-2x_0 z + 1)(4z^2 + pz + d)\\]</p><p>for some real $p$. Expanding this polynomial and comparing the coefficients, we have the following equations:</p><p>\\[p-8x_0 = a\\]\\[d+4-2px_0 = b\\]\\[p-2dx_0 = c\\]</p><p>From the first and the third we may deduce that $2x_0 = \\frac{a-c}{d-4}$ and that $p=\\frac{da-4c}{d-4}$, if $d\\neq 4$ (we will consider $d=4$ by the end). Let $k=2px_0=\\frac{(a-c)(da-4c)}{(4-d)^2}$. From the second equation, we know that $k=d+4-b$ is non-negative.</p><p>Consider the following cases:</p><p>Case 1: $a=c$.

However, $da \\leq 4c$, therefore $da-4c=0$. This is true only when $d=c$. Also, we get $k=0$ again. In this case, $b=d+4$, so $a=b=4$, $c=d=0$, $x_0=-1/2$. $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/3}$. $P(1)=12$.</p><p>Last case: $d=4$. We have $a=b=c=d=4$ and that $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/5}$. $P(1)=20$.</p><p>Therefore the desired sum is $60+12+20=92 ...\\framebox{B}$.</p>",
        "<p>First, notice that $z=1$ cannot be a root of the polynomial because $a,b,c,d \\geq 0$. Multiplying the polynomial by $(z-1)$ yields $P(z)(z-1) = 4z^5-(4-a)z^4-(a-b)z^3-(b-c)z^2-(c-d)z-d$, so for $z \\neq 1$ to be a root of $P(z)$, $4z^5 = (4-a)z^4+(a-b)z^3+(b-c)z^2+(c-d)z+d$. Now we consider the root $z_0$ with $|z_0|=1$. $|4z_0^5| = 4$, so the right hand side must have absolute value 4. By the triangle inequality, $|(4-a)z_0^4+(a-b)z_0^3+(b-c)z_0^2+(c-d)z_0+d|$ $\\leq |(4-a)z_0^4|+|(a-b)z_0^3| + |(b-c)z_0^2| + |(c-d)z_0|+d$ $= (4-a)+(a-b)+(b-c)+(c-d)+d=4$, with equality if and only if each of $4z_0^5$, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, $(c-d)z_0$, and $d$ is either zero or in the same direction as all the others when looked at as vectors in the complex plane. </p><p>We can now divide into two cases: $d \\neq 0$ and $d=0$. If $d \\neq 0$, then $4z_0^5$ must be real by the previous argument, so $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity. Also, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, and $(c-d)z_0$ must all be zero because if $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity, none of these can be real numbers with positive absolute value. Therefore, $a=4$, $b=a$, $c=b$, and $d=c$, leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4)$. Just to be sure, we can easily verify that this solution leads to the six complex numbers under question being in the same direction.</p><p>If $d=0$, then each of $4z_0^5$, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, and $cz_0$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others, so each of $4z_0^4$, $(4-a)z_0^3$, $(a-b)z_0^2$, $(b-c)z_0$, and $c$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others. We can divide this into two cases: $c \\neq 0$ and $c=0$. If $c \\neq 0$, then $4z_0^4$ must be real. Then, $z_0$ is a fourth root of unity. If $z_0$ is not a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$, $(a-b)z_0^2$, and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero, implying that $a=4$, $b=a=4$, and $c=b=4$, leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,0)$. If $z_0$ is also a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$ and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero but $(a-b)z_0^2$ can be anything. This implies $a=4$ and $b=c$ with no other restrictions, leading to the new solutions $(a,b,c,d) = (4,3,3,0), (4,2,2,0), (4,1,1,0), (4,0,0,0)$. </p><p>If $c=0$, then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^3$, $(4-a)z_0^2$, $(a-b)z_0$, and $b$ must be zero or in the same direction as all the others. If $b \\neq 0$, then $z_0$ must be a third root of unity, so $(4-a)z_0^2$ and $(a-b)z_0$ must be zero, implying $a=b=4$, leading to the new solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,0,0)$. </p><p>If $b=0$, then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^2$, $(4-a)z_0$, and $a$ must be zero or in the same direction as the others. For $|z_0|=1$, $a = 4$, but we have already counted the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,0,0,0)$. </p><p>Then, the complete list of solutions is $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4),(4,4,4,0),(4,3,3,0),(4,2,2,0),(4,1,1,0),(4,0,0,0),(4,4,0,0)$, leading to a sum of $\\framebox{B}=92$.</p>"

        "<p>Consider reflections. For any right triangle $ABC$ with the right labeling described in the problem, any reflection $A'B'C'$ labeled that way will give us $\\tan CBA \\cdot \\tan C'B'A' = 1$. First we consider the reflection about the line $y=2.5$. Only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex at $(0,5)$ do not reflect to a traingle $\\subseteq T$. Within those triangles, consider a reflection about the line $y=5-x$. Then only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex on the line $y=0$ do not reflect to a triangle $\\subseteq T$. So we only need to look at right triangles that have vertices $(0,5), (*,0), (*,*)$. There are three cases:</p><p>Case 1: $A=(0,5)$. Then $B=(*,0)$ is impossible.</p><p>Case 2: $B=(0,5)$. Then we look for $A=(x,y)$ such that $\\angle BAC=90^{\\circ}$ and that $C=(*,0)$. They are: $(A=(x,5), C=(x,0))$, $(A=(3,2), C=(1,0))$ and $(A=(4,1), C=(3,0))$. The product of their values of $\\tan \\angle CBA$ is $\\frac{5}{1}\\cdot  \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{625}{144}$.</p><p>Case 3: $C=(0,5)$. Then $A=(*,0)$ is impossible.</p><p>Therefore $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}  \\ \\frac{625}{144}}$ is the answer.</p>",
