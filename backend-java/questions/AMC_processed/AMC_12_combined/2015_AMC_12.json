The points where the ellipse intersects the coordinate axes are $(0, 1), (0, -1), (4, 0)$, and $(-4, 0)$. Recall that the two foci lie on the major axis of the ellipse and are a distance of $c$ away from the center of the ellipse, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, with $a$ being half the length of the major (longer) axis and $b$ being half the minor (shorter) axis of the ellipse.

The value for $b$ is achieved when the circle passes through the foci and only three points on the ellipse, which is possible when the circle touches $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$. Which point we use does not change what value of $b$ is attained, so we use $(0, -1)$. Here, we must find the point $(0, y)$ such that the distance from $(0, y)$ to both foci and $(0, -1)$ is the same. Now, we have the two following equations. \\[(\\sqrt{15})^2 + (y)^2 = b^2\\] \\[y + 1 = b \\implies y = b - 1\\] Substituting for $y$, we have that \\[15 + (b - 1)^2 = b^2 \\implies -2b + 16 = 0.\\]</p><p>Solving the above simply yields that $b = 8$, so our answer is $a + b = \\sqrt{15} + 8 \\textbf{ (D)}$.</p>",

Let $x$ denote the length of the line segment from the origin to the lower point on the circle. Note that $x$ lies on the diameter. Then by POP, we have$x \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot \\sqrt{15},$ yielding $x=15$, and so the radius of the circle is $(15+1)/2=8,$ so $b=8.$Thus $a+b=\\sqrt{15}+8 \\textbf{ (D)}$. </p><p>~ ccx09 (Roy Boy Apple Short Long)</p>",

For the circle to hit the ellipse four times, $\\sqrt{n^2+15}>n+1$ ($n+1$ being the distance between the circle's center and the farthest end of the ellipse that lies on the y-axis). Both sides are evidently positive, so we can square both sides, leaving $n^2+15>n^2+2n+1 \\implies n<7$. The function for the radius $\\sqrt{n^2+15}$ is always increasing as $n$ increases right of $n=0$ and as $n$ decreases left of $n=0$.

Let's pick a point on our segment and denote it with $(x, 0)$. Then, there are three ways a second point can be within the boundaries of this first point. Either, it is to the left of it (if possible), to the right of it, or it is on the segment that forms a right angle with it. </p><p>Obviously, there is $x$ distance if the point is to the left of the point $x$.

We can do this simply by doing $4- \\frac{6-\\pi}{8}$ (as $4$ is the total amount of length).

Drop altitudes $a$ and $b$ from the center of $Z$ to these radii $x$ and $y$, respectively, and drop altitude $c$ from the center of $Y$ to radius $x$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Connect the centers of circles $x$, $y$, and $z$ with their radii, and utilize the Pythagorean Theorem. We attain the following equations. \\[(x - z)^2 + a^2 = (x + z)^2 \\implies a^2 = 4xz\\] \\[(y - z)^2 + b^2 = (y + z)^2 \\implies b^2 = 4yz\\] \\[(x - y)^2 + c^2 = (x + y)^2 \\implies c^2 = 4xy\\]</p><p>We see that $a = 2\\sqrt{xz}$, $b = 2\\sqrt{yz}$, and $c = 2\\sqrt{xy}$. Since $a + b = c$, we have that $2\\sqrt{xz} + 2\\sqrt{yz} = 2\\sqrt{xy}$. Divide this equation by $2\\sqrt{xyz}$, and this equation becomes the well-known relation of Descartes's Circle Theorem $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}}.$ We can apply this relationship recursively with the circles in layers $L_2, L_3, \\cdots, L_6$.</p><p>Here, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of all circles in layer $n$. The notation in the problem asks us to find the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the radii in each circle in this collection, which is $\\textstyle\\sum_{n=0}^{6}S(n)$. We already have that $S(0) = S(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}} = \\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}$. Then, $S(2) = 2S(1) + S(0) = 3S(0)$. Additionally, $S(3) = 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 9S(0)$, and $S(4) = 2S(3) + 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 27S(0)$. Now, we notice that $S(n + 1) = 3S(n)$ because $S(n + 1) = 2S(n) + 2S(n - 1) + \\cdots + 2S(1) + S(0)$, which is a power of $3.$ Hence, our desired sum is $(1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243)(S(0)) = 365\\left(\\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}\\right)$.

Now, let the circle of $L_1$ have radius $r_3$. Let this circle be circle $C$. Draw the radii of the three circles down to the common tangential line and connect the radii. Draw two lines parallel to the common tangential line of the two layers intersecting the center point of circle $B$ and the center point of circle $C$. Now, we have $3$ right triangles with a line of common length (The two parallel lines). Using the pythagorean theorem, we get the formula $\\sqrt{(r_2+r_1)^2-(r_2-r_1)^2}=\\sqrt{(r_1+r_3)^2-(r_1-r_3)^2}+\\sqrt{(r_2+r_3)^2-(r_2-r_3)^2}$ Now we solve for $r_3$. Square both sides, use the identity $(a^2-b^2)=(a+b)(a-b)$ and simplify: $(2r_2)(2r_1) = (2r_1)(2r_3)+2\\sqrt{16r_1r_3r_2r_3}+(2r_2)(2r_3)=4(r_1r_3+r_2r_3+2r_3\\sqrt{r_1r_2})=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\\\ 4r_2r_1=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\implies r_3=\\frac{r_2r_1}{r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}}$</p><p><br/>Now, let's change this into a function to clean things up: $f(x,y) = \\frac{xy}{x+y+2\\sqrt{xy}}=\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}$Let's begin to rewrite the sum we want to find in terms of the radii of the circles, call this $g(x)$: $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{xy}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{y}+\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ Using this, we can find the sum of some layers: $L_0$, $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}$, $L_0$ and $L_1$: $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}+\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} = 2\\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg)$ This is interesting, we have that the sum of Layer 0 and Layer 1 is equal to twice of Layer 0. If we continue and find the sum of layers 0, 1 and 2, we see it is equal to $5(L_0)$. This is getting very interesting, there must be some pattern. First of all, we should observe that finding $g(x)$ of a circle is equivalent to adding up those of the 2 larger circles to construct the smaller one. Second, upon further observation, we can draw out the layers. When we're finding the next layer, we can split the current layers across the center, so that each half includes the center circle $L_1$. Now, if we were to find $g(x)$, we notice we are doubling the current sum and including the center circle twice. So, the recursive sum would be $a_n=3a_{n-1}-1$. So, applying this new formula, we get $\\sum_{C \\in S}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} = (3(3(3(3(3(3-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)\\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg )=365\\cdot \\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg)=365\\cdot\\frac{143}{70\\cdot73}=\\boxed{\\frac{143}{14}}$</p>",

We deal with each case separately.</p><p>For 2,2,2-cycles, suppose that one of the 2-cycles switches the people across from each other, i.e. $(14)$, $(25)$, or $(36)$. WLOG, we may assume it to be $(14)$. Then we could either have both of the other 2-cycles be across from each other, giving the permutation $(14)(25)(36)$ or else neither of the other 2-cycles is across from each other, in which case the only possible permutation is $(14)(26)(35)$. This can happen for $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well. So since the first permutation is not counted twice, we find a total of $1+3=4$ permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles where at least one of the 2-cycles switches people diametrically opposite from each other. Otherwise, since the elements in a 2-cycle cannot differ by 1, 3, or 5 mod 6, they must differ by 2 or 4 mod 6, i.e. they must be of the same parity. But since we have three odd and three even elements, this is impossible. Hence there are exactly 4 such permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles.</p><p>For 4,2-cycles, we assume for the moment that 1 is part of the 2-cycle. Then the 2-cycle can be $(13)$, $(15)$, or $(14)$. The first two are essentially the same by symmetry, and we must arrange the elements 2, 4, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. However, 5 must have two neighbors that are not next to it, which is impossible, hence the first two cases yield no permutations. If the 2-cycle is $(14)$, then we must arrange the elements 2, 3, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. Then 2 must have the neighbors 5 and 6. We find that the 4-cycles $(2536)$ and $(2635)$ satisfy the desired properties, yielding the permutations $(14)(2536)$ and $(14)(2635)$. This can be done for the 2-cycles $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well, so we find a total of 6 such permutations that are 4,2-cycles.</p><p>For 3,3-cycles, note that if 1 neighbor 4, then the third element in the cycle will neighbor one of 1 and 4, so this is impossible.

Therefore, we obtain the four 3,3-cycles $(135)(246)$, $(153)(246)$, $(135)(264)$, and $(153)(264)$.</p><p>For 6-cycles, note that the neighbors of 1 can be 3 and 4, 3 and 5, or 4 and 5. In the first case, we may assume that it looks like $(314\\dots)$ -- the form $(413\\dots)$ is also possible but equivalent to this case. Then we must place the elements 2, 5, and 6. Note that 5 and 6 cannot go together, so 2 must go in between them. Also, 5 cannot neighbor 4, so we are left with one possibility, namely $(314625)$, which has an analogous possibility $(413526)$. In the second case, we assume that it looks like $(315\\dots)$. The 2 must go next to the 5, and the 6 must go last (to neighbor the 3), so the only possibility here is $(315246)$, with the analogous possibility $(513642)$. In the final case, we may assume that it looks like $(415\\dots)$. Then the 2 and 3 cannot go together, so the 6 must go in between them. Therefore, the only possibility is $(415362)$, with the analogous possibility $(514263)$.

        "<p>We first notice that if the bee is turning 30 degrees each turn, it will take 12 turns to be looking in the same direction when the bee initially left.

From here we can draw a perpendicular from $P_2$ to the line $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ intersecting a point $C_0$. We will also place the point $C_1$ at the intersection of $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ and $\\overline{P_3P_4}$.

Finally, the point $C_10$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_{9}P_{10}}$ and $\\overline{P_{12}P_{13}}$. Note that our spiral stops at $P_{12}$ before the next spiral starts. Calculating the offset from the x and the y direction, we see that the offset, or the new point $P_{12}$, is $({-6}, {-6}-12 \\sqrt{3})$. This is an interesting property that the points\u2019 coordinate changes by a constant offset no matter what $n$ is. Since the new point\u2019s subscript changes by 12 each time and we see that 2016 is divisible by 12, the point $P_{2016} = ({-168} \\cdot {6}, {168} \\cdot ({-6} \\sqrt{3} {-12}))$.

Using the distance formula, the numbers cancel out nicely (1008 is divisible by 168, so take 168 when using the distance formula) and we see that the final answer is $(1008)(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2})$ which gives us a final answer of $\\boxed{2024}$.</p><p>-bowmanrocks32</p><p><br/></p>",

It follows that $P_(2015) = (-1008-1008\\sqrt{3}, -1008-1008\\sqrt{3})$ so the distance to $P_0$ is $1008(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6})$ so the answer is $1008 + 2 + 1008 + 6 = \\boxed{\\text{(B) } 2024}$.</p><p>- bobjoebilly</p>"
