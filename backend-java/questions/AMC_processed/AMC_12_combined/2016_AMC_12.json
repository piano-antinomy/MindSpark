        "<p>The triangle inequality simplifies to considering only one case: $\\text{the smallest side+ the second smallest side} > \\text{the largest side}$. Consider the complement (the same statement, except with a less than or equal to). Assume (WLOG) $a$ is the largest, so on average $a=1/2$ (now equal to becomes a degenerate case with probability $0$, so we no longer need to consider it). We now want $b+c<1/2$, so imagine choosing $b+c$ at once rather than independently. But we know that $b+c$ is between $0$ and $2$. The complement is thus: $(1/2-0)/2=1/4$. But keep in mind that we choose each $b$ and $c$ randomly and independently, so if there are $k$ ways to choose $b+c$ together, there are $2k$ ways to choose them separately, and therefore the complement actually doubles to match each case (a good example of this is to restrict b and c to integers such that if $b+c=3$, then we only count this once, but in reality: we have two cases $1+2$, and $2+1$; similar reasoning also generalizes to non-integral values). The complement is then actually $2(1/4)=1/2$. Therefore, our desired probability is given by $1-\\text{complement}=1/2, C$</p>",

Bernardo and Silvia take turns writing and erasing numbers on a blackboard as follows: Bernardo starts by writing the smallest perfect square with $k+1$ digits. Every time Bernardo writes a number, Silvia erases the last $k$ digits of it. Bernardo then writes the next perfect square, Silvia erases the last $k$ digits of it, and this process continues until the last two numbers that remain on the board differ by at least 2. Let $f(k)$ be the smallest positive integer not written on the board. For example, if $k = 1$, then the numbers that Bernardo writes are $16, 25, 36, 49, 64$, and the numbers showing on the board after Silvia erases are $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $6$, and thus $f(1) = 5$. What is the sum of the digits of $f(2) + f(4)+ f(6) + \\dots + f(2016)$?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>Consider $f(2)$. The numbers left on the blackboard will show the hundreds place at the end. In order for the hundreds place to differ by 2, the difference between two perfect squares needs to be at least $100$. Since $100\\le (x+1)^2-x^2=2x+1$, this first happens at $x\\ge \\lfloor 99/2\\rfloor = 50$. The perfect squares from here go: $2500,  2601, 2704, 2809\\dots$. Note that the ones and tens also make the perfect squares, $1^2,2^2,3^2\\dots$. After the ones and tens make $100$, the hundreds place will go up by $2$, thus reaching our goal. Since $10^2=100$, the last perfect square to be written will be $\\left(50+10\\right)^2=60^2=3600$. The missing number is one less than the number of hundreds $(k=2)$ of $3600$, or $35$.</p><p>Now consider $f(4)$. Instead of the difference between two squares needing to be $100$, the difference must now be $10000$. This first happens at $x\\ge 5000$. After this point, similarly, $\\sqrt{10000}=100$ more numbers are needed to make the $10^4$ th's place go up by $2$. This will take place at $\\left(5000+100\\right)^2=5100^2= 26010000$. Removing the last four digits (the zeros) and subtracting one yields $2600$ for the skipped value.</p><p>In general, each new value of $f(k+2)$ will add two digits to the \"$5$\" and one digit to the \"$1$\". This means that the last number Bernardo writes for $k=6$ is $\\left(500000+1000\\right)^2$, the last for $k = 8$ will be $\\left(50000000+10000\\right)^2$, and so on until $k=2016$. Removing the last $k$ digits as Silvia does will be the same as removing $k/2$ trailing zeroes on the number to be squared. This means that the last number on the board for $k=6$ is $5001^2$, $k=8$ is $50001^2$, and so on. So the first missing number is $5001^2-1,50001^2-1\\text{ etc.}$ The squaring will make a \"$25$\" with two more digits than the last number, a \"$10$\" with one more digit, and a \"$1$\". The missing number is one less than that, so the \"1\" will be subtracted from $f(k)$. In other words, $f(k) = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2}+1\\cdot 10^{k/2}$.</p><p>Therefore:</p><p>\\[f(2) =35 =25 +10\\]\\[f(4) =2600 =2500 +100\\]\\[f(6) =251000 =250000 +1000\\]\\[f(8) = 25010000 = 25000000 + 10000\\]</p><p>And so on.

We could use calculus like we did in the solution immediately above this one, but that's a lot of work and we don't have a ton of time. To minimize the positive value of this fraction, we must maximize the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex. The vertex of this quadratic occurs at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{-(\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}$.</p>",
        "<p>\\[\\textbf{Completing the Square and Quadratics}\\]Let $r$ be the common ratio. If the second term is $1$, the first must be $\\frac{1}{r}$.

To find the minimum value of S, we must find the maximum value of the denominator, $r(1-r)$, which is $\\frac{1}{4}$, completing the square.

The first and third part of the condition are already met by our wlog, so we just need to count of number of ways the second condition is true (a team in X beats a team in Y).

Then for the prime factorization $N=2^{k_2}3^{k_3}5^{k_5}\\ldots$ we must have $77000=f(k_2)f(k_3)f(k_5)\\ldots$ So let's take a look at the function $f(k)$ by counting the quadruplets we just mentioned.</p><p>There are $14$ quadruplets which consist only of $0$ and $k$. Then there are $36(k-1)$ quadruplets which include three different values, and $12(k-1)(k-2)$ with four. Thus $f(k)=14+12(k-1)(3+k-2)=14+12(k^2-1)$ and the first few values from $k=1$ onwards are \\[14,50,110,194,302,434,590,770,\\ldots\\] Straight away we notice that $14\\cdot 50\\cdot 110=77000$, so the prime factorization of $N$ can use the exponents $1,2,3$. To make it as small as possible, assign the larger exponents to smaller primes. The result is $N=2^33^25^1=360$, so $n=360\\cdot 77=27720$ which is answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$.</p><p>Also, to get the above formula of $f(k)=12 k^2+2$, we can also use the complementary counting by doing $(k+1)^4-k^4-k^4+(k-1)^4$, while the first term $(k+1)^4$ is for the four integers to independently have $k+1$ choices each, with the second term indicating to subtract all the possibilities for the four integers to have values between $0$ and $k-1$, and similarly the third term indicating to subtract all the possibilities for the four integers to have values between $1$ and $k$, in the end the fourth term meaning the make up for the values between $1$ and $k-1$.</p>"

        "<p>Since the product $a_1a_2\\cdots a_k$ is an integer, it must be a power of $2$, so the sum of the base-$2$ logarithms must be an integer.
