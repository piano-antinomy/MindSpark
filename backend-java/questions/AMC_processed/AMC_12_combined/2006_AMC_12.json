There are 3 choices for the bug's first move from the starting vertex, and 2 choices for the bug's second move (it can't go back to the previous vertices). Then, notice that the bug has 3 choices of an odd vertex to end on not including the vertex the bug went to on move 1. Now pick 1 of the 3 ending vertices to end on. Notice that there are only 6 valid paths from start to finish (1 valid path after moves 1 and 2) to that point because all the moves are forced after the first 2 moves (try it out). Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 18$ valid paths the bug can take. There are $3^7 = 2187$total paths, so the answer is 18/2187 = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{2}{243}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let the cube have vertices $ABCDEFGH$ such that $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are two opposite faces with $A$ above $E$ and $B$ above $F$. The bug starts at $A$ and every step has 3 choices so that there're $3^7 = 2187$ possible paths. We can split the case into odd and even steps. After an odd number of steps, the possible points that can be reached are $B$,$D$,$G$,$E$. Then, for even-numbered steps, the remaining points can be reached. Since he has taken seven steps, the end point must be one of the points in $B$,$D$,$G$,$E$. At this point, we classify and discuss the movement trajectory of the bug. </p><p>Case 1: It moves to another plane after completing one plane. If it starts on the upper plane, there are two possibilities for the first step, $B$ or $D$. The second and third steps are restricted to the upper plane, and the fourth step will move to the nearby point on another plane. These three steps have only one possibility each, so there is no need for classification. Then, when it reaches the lower plane, the fifth step has two possibilities, thus limiting the sixth and seventh steps as well. Proceeding in this way, the bug can also move from left to right or from front to back. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ situations. </p><p>Case 2: Opposite to case 1, it can directly pass through to another point G on the other diagonal of the cube within the first three steps. There are three choices for the first step, two choices for the second step, and only one choice for the third step. Therefore, there are $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ situations for the first three steps. The subsequent steps will be restricted to a single path (try it yourself). </p><p>In summary, there are 12 + 6 = 18 situations in total. Therefore, the final probability is 18/2187 = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac2{243}}$.</p><p>~ A mystery eastern egg (wtng)</p>"

This means that if an element $e$ is put into the subset, both $e-1$ and $e+1$ are no longer possibilities. Assume that all subsets are ordered from least to greatest (we are looking for the number of combinations, so we can order these combinations however we want). Then the first element will be $s$ (as a reminder, the lowest possible element in a subset is $s$), the second element will be at least $s+2$, and so on. After $s$ elements are chosen, we will have skipped $s-1$ elements (these are the elements that were \"eliminated\" as they were consecutive). Therefore, we ignore exactly $s-1$ elements (if we ignore more or less elements, then $s$ changes) Since we must ignore $s-1$ elements, we can simply remove those beforehand. ($16-s)-(s-1) = 17-2s$ possible elements</p><p>Now we look for the bounds of $s$. We are looking for non-empty subsets, so $s\\ge1$. If $s$ is too large, there will not be enough non-consecutive terms between $s$ and $15$. Specifically, the highest element in a subset using \"optimal\" selection will be $s+2(s-1)$ or $3s-2$. If $3s-1>15$, that means s is too large. Therefore $3s-2\\le15$; solving for $s$ yields $s\\le5$. Now we know that $1 \\le s \\le 5$.</p><p>We want to know the number of ways to arrange $17-2s$ \"balls\" into $s$ identical \"boxes\" with at most $1$ ball per box, for $s=1$ to $s=5$. This is equivalent to $\\sum_{s=1}^{5}{17-2s \\choose s} = 405$, or $\\boxed{\\text{E}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We will split the problem into cases, and maybe one could then generalize this to arbitrary $n$. </p><p>$\\bold{Case 1}:$ ($n=15, k=1$). Then this is easy. We have $\\binom{15}{1}=15$.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 2}:$ ($n=14, k=2$). Now we have something tricky. To get a good grasp on this case, let us consider the smallest element; $2$, in the first spot. We then have $15-1=14$ numbers left. However, we cannot have the digit $3$. Hence we have to choose $2$ numbers from $14-1=13$ integers left. This can be done in $\\binom{13}{2}=78$ ways.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 3}:$ ($n=13, k=3$). As in the last case, we can use the smallest element to get a good grasp on this case. Put the digit $3$ in the first spot. Then there are $11$ integers left for the second spot. But in total, we have to avoid $2$ elements for each subset of cardinality $3$ ${a,b,c}$. So we have to choose $3$ elements from $13-2=11$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways. </p><p>$\\bold{Case 4}:$ ($n=12, k=4$). As in the previous case, we have to avoid $3$ numbers, and choose $4$ from them. Which is choosing $4$ elements from $12-3=9$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 5}:$ ($n=11, k=4$). Now you are accustomed to the strategy.

        "<p>We can write the given equation as \\[\\sin^3x + \\sin^3y \\le \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin x + \\sin y).\\] Note that when $x = 0$, we have $\\sin y \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ which implies $y \\le \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.

Moreover, if instead we have $a_i = 0$ for some $i > 2$, then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2} = 1$.</p><p><b>Proof:</b> By the way $(a_n)$ is constructed in the problem statement, having two equal consecutive terms $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ implies that $a_i$ divides every term in the sequence. So $a_i | 999$ and $a_i | a_2$, so $a_i | \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$, so $a_i = 1$. For the proof of the second result, note that if $a_i = 0$, then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}$, so by the first result we just proved, $a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1$.</p><p><b>Lemma:</b> $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$.</p><p><b>Proof:</b> Suppose $(a_n)$ completed at some $i > 2000$ or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither $999$ nor $a_2$ are $0$, none of the pairs $(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})$ can have a $0$ or be equal to $(1, 1)$. So the first lemma implies\\[\\max(a_1, a_2) > \\max(a_3, a_4) > \\cdots > \\max(a_{1999}, a_{2000})  > 0,\\]so $999 = \\max(a_1, a_2) \\geq 1000$, a contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$.</p><p><br/>Now we're ready to find exactly which values of $a_2$ we want to count.</p><p>Let's keep in mind that $2006 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and that $a_1 = 999$ is odd.

This tells us what we need to count.</p><p><br/>There are $\\phi(999) = 648$ numbers less than $999$ and relatively prime to it ($\\phi$ is the Euler totient function). We want to count how many of these are odd. Note that\\[t \\mapsto 999 - t\\]is a 1-1 correspondence between the odd and even numbers less than and relatively prime to $999$.

        "<p>As in Solution 1, we show that $a_2$ must be odd. We notice that, after experimentation, all numbers eventually end up in a sequence $1,1,0,1,1,0,\\ldots$, which points to the assumption that every $2$ out of $3$ values for $a_2$ work due to residue classes. Combining this with an estimated 50-50 chance that these values are either odd or even, since $999$ values are nonnegative integers less than $999$, we can estimate that there are about $999\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=333$ different values of $a_2$ that work. The closest answer choice by far is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }324}$.</p><p>~eevee9406</p>"
