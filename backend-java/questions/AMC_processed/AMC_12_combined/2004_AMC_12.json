We get $a_5 = 2002+2003-2000 = 2005$, $a_6=2003+2000-2005=1998$, $a_7=2000+2005-1998=2007$, and so on.</p><p>We can now discover the following pattern: $a_{2k+1} = 2001+2k$ and $a_{2k}=2004-2k$.

Quickly notice that after taking away 1 and 2, the 2nd term is 0, the 4th term is -2, the 6th term is -4, the 8th term is -6, etc. Thus, in the sequence without 1 and 2, the (2n)th term has a value of -2(n-1). Therefore, to find the 2004th term in the original sequence, we take away the first 2 values to form the new sequence so the value of the 2004th term in the original sequence is the 2002nd term in the new sequence. 2002 is 2 times 1001. Thus, the value is -2(1001-1)= -2000. BUT, REMEMBER THAT AT THE START WE TOOK AWAY 2000 FROM EACH TERM. ADD -2000 TO 2000 TO GET $\\boxed{0}$. LOLOL</p>",
