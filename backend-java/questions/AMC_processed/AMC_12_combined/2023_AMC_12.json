So the answer is 8. It can be done even if one does not remember that 45 squared is 2025, all it takes is intuition. One can easily see mentally that 5 x 8 that is 40 squared is 1600, and then one has to do just one more computation and see that 5 x 9 that is 45 squared exceeds 2023, so the answer is 8. </p><p>~edit by RobinDaBank</p><p>Note that you can find the square of any number that ends in 5 by taking the number 5 more than it and the number 5 less than it, multiplying those together, and adding 25.

Now we know the formula for how many games are played in this tournament is $n(n-1)/2$, the sum of the first $n-1$ triangular numbers. Now, setting 36 and 48 equal to the equation will show that two consecutive numbers must have a product of 72 or 96.

This brings us down to two answer choices, $B$ and $D$. We note that the answer is some number $x$ choose $2$. This means the answer is in the form $x(x-1)/2$.

Note that we can generate the number of valid sequences of $A$ by first generating all sequences of $b$ such that $b_i\\leq{}b_{i+1}$ for all $1\\leq{}i<n$, then choosing the elements from $A_{k+1}$ that we keep in $A_k$, given the sequence of $b$ as the restraint for the number of elements.

In the second case, consider the last term in $b$ that is not 10 or 5, say $b_m$.

Therefore, we only need to consider sequences of $b$ where each term is $0$ $5$ or $10$.

If there exists at least one term $b_k=5$, then we use stars and bars to count the number of sequences of $b$, and each sequence of $b$ corresponds to $\\binom{10}{5}$ sequences of $A$.

      "question": "<p>When $n$ standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values. What is $n$?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>We start by trying to prove a function of $n$, and then we can apply the function and equate it to $936$ to find the value of $n$.</p><p>It is helpful to think of this problem in the format $(1+2+3+4+5+6) \\cdot (1+2+3+4+5+6) \\dots$. Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a $1$ for one factor and then a $5$ for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for $n=2$, $4$ can be reached by picking $1$ and $4$ or $2$ and $2$. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.</p><p>Note that there are only $3$ primes in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$: $2,3,$ and $5$. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values. </p><p>We start our work on representing $j$: the powers of $5$, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$. Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$. </p><p>Suppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$. These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$, this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$. </p><p>Now we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$'s and the number of $5$'s our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?</p><p>In the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$. However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$, if we choose a $6$. The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$, which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$. </p><p>We now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$. For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$. Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$.</p><p>Now if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$, which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$. Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$. Therefore the powers of $2$, and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$, so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$. </p><p>Now to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$s and $j$s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$: the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$, since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.</p><p>\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j\\]</p><p>We start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$. Set $i$ to $0$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$, then set $i$ to $1$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$, etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Therefore the left summation evaluates to \\[\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Now we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$. This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$. Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$, the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$.</p><p>In the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$. Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$, so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$. We can rearrange this as $((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)$</p><p>\\[= \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1\\]</p><p>We can write this in easier terms as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k$\\[=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}\\]\\[= \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\\]</p><p>We multiply this by $3$ to obtain that \\[\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Thus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ is:\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\\[= \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)\\]\\[= \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Now most of the work is done. We set this equal to $936$ and prime factorize. $936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$, so $(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.

Other transformation like 1*6*6=3*3*4 can be viewed as a 1*6=2*3 combined with a 2*6=3*4. </p><p>So we can transform any given combination into a \"normallised\" combination in this way: step 1, if there are 1 and 6, then transorm them into 2*3; step 2, if there are both 1 and 4, then transform them into a 2*2; step3: if there are both 2 and 6, then transform them into 3*4. Until no more basic transformation can be made.</p><p>Now begin casework with $k_1$:</p><p>case 1($k_1 <= k_6$): all \"1\"s cancel with \"6\"s, so the product contains only 2,3,4,5,6. And now:</p><p>If \"2\"s are no more than remaining \"6\"s: all \"2\"s cancel with \"6\"s, so the \"nomarlized\" product consists of only $\"3456\"$, with the total number of dice unchanged. No transformation can be made now and it is the same with n stars and 3 bars, so there are $C^3_{n+3}$ ways. </p><p>If \"2\"s are no less than remaining \"6\"s: all \"6\" cancels with \"2\", so the product consist of only $\"2345\"$. Again, there are $C^3_{n+3}$ ways.</p><p>case 2($k_1>=k_6$): all \"6\" cancels with \"1\", the remaining numbers are: 1,2,3,4,5; now if \"1\"s are no less than \"4\"s, then it can be transformed into product with only $\"1235\"$; there are, again, $C^3_{n+3}$ ways. if \"1\"s are no more than \"4\", then it is product with only 2,3,4,5, which is already counted before.</p><p>So there are three major cases: $\"2345\"$, $\"3456\"$ and $\"1235\"$, each with $C^3_{n+3}$ ways. There are overlaps: $3^{k_3} 4^{k_4} 5^{k_5}$, which has $C^2_{n+2}$ ways, are counted in both $\"2345\"$ and $\"3456\"$, and $2^{k_2} 3^{k_3} 5^{k_5}$ are counted in both $\"2345\"$ and $\"1235\"$.</p><p>So, the final number is: \\[3C^3_{n+3}-2C^2_{n+2}=\\frac{(n+1)^2 (n+2)}{2},\\]and now any possible product is counted exactly once. And then it is easily to find out $n = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 11}}$.</p><p>~FireSirius</p>",
        "<p>We define:</p><p>$a_n$ is the number of possible products of the results of $n$ dice being rolled.</p><p><br/>Now consider a modified five-sided die that excludes $5$, having faces $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$. Let the number of possible products of the results of $n$ of these modified dice be equal to $b_n$.</p><p>If in the $n$ rolls of the dice, we roll $5$ zero times, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_n$. If we roll $5$ once, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-1}$. In general, if we roll $5$ $i$ times, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-i}$. Between the different cases of how many times we roll $5$, the products are guaranteed to be distinct. This is because in their prime factorizations, the powers of $5$ are different, and by the Fundmamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the products must be different as well.</p><p>In other words, we have found:\\[a_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i\\]</p><p>Now let us focus on $b_n$, and from now on, until otherwise specified, the die will refer to the modified, 5-sided die.In these $n$ rolls of the dice, if we roll $3$ zero times and $6$ zero times, then the product must be a power of $2$. It can range from $2^0$ to $4^n$, which is equal to $2^{2n}$. Therefore, there are $2n+1$ possible products. If we either roll $3$ once or $6$ once (not both), then the product must be $3$ times a power of $2$. This power of $2$ can range from $2^0$ to $2^{2(n-1)+1}=2^{2n-1}$, when we roll one $6$ and all other rolls are $4$. Therefore, there are $2n$ products. In general, if we roll $3$ and $6$ a combined $i$ times, then the product must be in the form $2^k * 3^i$, and $k$ ranges from $0$ to $2(n-i)+i=2n-i$, resulting in $2n-i+1$ products.</p><p>In other words, we have found:\\[b_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} 2n-i+1\\]</p><p>We can now calculate $b_n$. Writing out the full sum, we get:\\[b_n=(2n+1)+(2n)+\\cdots+(n+1)\\]This simplifies to:\\[b_n=\\frac{(n+1)(3n+2)}{2}=\\frac{3n^2+5n+2}{2}\\]</p><p>Now, finally, we can calculate $a_n$:\\[a_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i\\]</p><p>\\[=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{3i^2+5i+2}{2}\\]</p><p>\\[=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{3i^2}{2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{5i}{2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} 1\\]</p><p>\\[=\\frac{3}{2}*\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{5}{2}*\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1)\\]</p><p>\\[=(n+1)(\\frac{n(2n+1)}{4}+\\frac{5n}{4}+1)\\]</p><p>\\[=(n+1)(\\frac{2n^2+6n+4}{4})\\]</p><p>\\[=\\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Finally, plugging in $a_n=936$, we get that $n=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 11}}$.</p><p>~primenumbersfun</p>"

Now since $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles, $TD = DK$ and $UK = DK-DU = TD-DU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})-\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (sec^2(54^{\\circ})-2) = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1)$.</p><p>Now $FU = UK \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ}) \\implies FU \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1) \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ})$. Now note that $tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x) = 1$ because opposite over adjacent cancel each other out in a right triangle. Thus, $FU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))$</p><p>Now, \\[\\frac{DU}{FU} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))} = \\frac{2}{tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ})}\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies \\frac{[DU]}{[FU]} = \\frac{4}{(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2} \\implies 10 \\cdot [FU] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>Now we go back to our first equation and plug in our values:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = 1+\\sqrt{5}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})+\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (4-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2)\\]</p><p>Note $(tan(x)-tan(90-x))^2 = tan^2(x)-2 \\cdot tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x)+tan^2(90-x) = tan^2(x)-2+tan^2(90-x)$.</p><p>Also note that $tan^2(x)+1 = sec^2(x)$.Thus \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2+(-1)+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) \\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\].</p><p>Now all that remains is to find $tan^2(36^{\\circ})$. We can use the tan addition formula to find the general form of $tan(5x)$ or remember question 25 from this year's AMC 12A. We have that \\[tan(5x) = \\frac{5tan(x)-10tan^3(x)+tan^5(x)}{1-10tan^2(x)+5tan^4(x)}\\]. </p><p>Plug in $x=36$. Then we have \\[tan(180^{\\circ}) = \\frac{5tan(36^{\\circ})-10tan^3(36^{\\circ})+tan^5(36^{\\circ})}{1-10tan^2(36^{\\circ})+5tan^4(36^{\\circ})}\\]Now let $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$. We have the equation \\[\\frac{5y-10y^3+y^5}{1-10y^2+5y^4} = 0 \\implies 5y-10y^3+y^5 = 0\\]\\[\\implies 5-10y^2+y^4 = 0 \\implies 5-10z+z^2 = 0\\]Where we let $z = y^2$. Using the quadratic formula, we have \\[z = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\\]Now since $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$, $z = tan^2(36^{\\circ})$, which is what we were looking for. Notice that $tan(0^{\\circ}) = 0$ and $tan(45^{\\circ}) = 1$, so $tan(36^{\\circ})$ is between $0$ and $1$, and so is it's square. Thus $z = 5 - 2\\sqrt{5}$, not the other root.</p><p>Finally:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+5-2\\sqrt{5})\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (6-2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}-4}{4} = \\sqrt{5}-1\\]</p><p>Therefore, \\[[FGHIJ] = \\sqrt{5}-1 = \\boxed{B}\\]</p><p><br/>~KingRavi</p>",

        "<p>Interestingly, we find that the pentagon we need is the one that is represented by the intersection of perpendicular bisectors of the connection from the center of the pentagon to one vertex.
