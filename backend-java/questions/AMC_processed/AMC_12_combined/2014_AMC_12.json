If we wanted to further check our pattern, we could count the total number of digits in our quotient (not counting the first three): 195. Since $99<100$, multiplying by it will produce either $1$ or $2$ extra digits, so our quotient passes the test.</p><p>Or note that the 1 has to be carried when you get to 100 so the 99 becomes 00 and the 1 gets carried again to 98 which becomes 99. </p><p><br/></p>"

Because we know that $c > a$ and $a + c \\le 7$ and $a \\ge 1$, we find that the only possible values for $a$ and $c$ are $1$ and $6$, respectively. Because $a + b + c \\le 7$, $b = 0$.

So we minimize $a,b,c,f,g,h,i$ in order to maximize $j$.
