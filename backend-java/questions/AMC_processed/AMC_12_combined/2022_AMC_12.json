By exponent properties, we separate the part with base $20$ to become $20^{\\log^2{5}} \\cdot 20^{\\log^2{20}-\\log^2{5}}$. Then, we substitute this into the original expression to get $\\log {( (5^{\\log^2{5}}) \\cdot 20^{\\log^2{5}} \\cdot 20^{\\log^2{20}-\\log^2{5}} \\cdot 8 ^ {\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}} ) } = \\log {( (100^{\\log^2{5}}) \\cdot 20^{\\log^2{20}-\\log^2{5}} \\cdot 8 ^ {\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}} ) }$. Because $100^{\\log^2{5}} = 25^{\\log{5}}$, and $\\log^2{20}-\\log^2{5} = (\\log{20}+\\log{5})(\\log{20}-\\log{5}) = \\log{100}\\cdot\\log{4} = 2\\log{4}$, this expression is equal to $\\log {( 25 ^ {\\log{5}} \\cdot 400^{\\log{4}} \\cdot 8 ^ {\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}} ) }$. We perform the step with the base combining on $25$ and $400$ to get $25 ^ {\\log{5}} \\cdot 400^{\\log{4}}  = 25 ^ {\\log{5}-\\log{4}} \\cdot 10000^{\\log{4}} = 25^{\\log{\\frac{5}{4}}}\\cdot 256$. Putting this back into the whole equation gives $\\log{( 25^{\\log{\\frac{5}{4}}}\\cdot 256 \\cdot 8^{\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}})}$. One last base merge remains - but $25\\cdot 8$ isn't a power of 10. We can rectify this by converting $8^{\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}}$ to $(4^\\frac{3}{2})^{\\log{\\frac{1}{4}}} = 4^{\\log{ \\frac{1}{8} }}$. Finally, we complete this arduous process by performing the base merge on $\\log{( 25^{\\log{\\frac{5}{4}}}\\cdot 256 \\cdot 4^{\\log{\\frac{1}{8}}})}$. We get $25^{\\log{\\frac{5}{4}}} \\cdot 4^{\\log{\\frac{1}{8}}} = 25^{\\log{\\frac{5}{4}}-\\log{\\frac{1}{8}}} \\cdot 100^{\\log{\\frac{1}{8}}} = 25^{\\log{10}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{25}{64}$. Putting this back into that original equation one last time, we get $\\log(256 \\cdot \\frac{25}{64}) = \\log{100} = \\boxed{2}$.~aop2014</p>"

Using the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of this polynomial, we have \\[x^{1011} = \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] Looking at our answer choices, we want to find a polynomial whose roots satisfy this expression. Since the expression $x^6+x^3+1$ is in a similar form to our original polynomial, except with $x^3$ in place of $x^{1011}$, this would be a good place to start. Solving for the roots of $x^3$ in a similar fashion, \\[x^3= \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] for the solution we are testing.

Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \\[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\\] which would mean \\[S_{2023} < 0\\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0.

For $n = 2$ (one edge of length $2$), since $w^{2i-2j} = (w^2)^{i-j} = 1^{i-j} = 1$ and similarly for $w^{2j-2i}$, the constant term in the summation becomes $8$ instead of $6$. For $n = 1$ (no edges), the constant term becomes $0$.</p><p>-maxamc</p><p>~edited by <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Emerald_block\" title=\"User:Emerald block\">emerald_block</a></p>",

        "<p>Obviously, each of the hexagon have area of $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which gives a total of $6\\sqrt{3}$ (without accounting for the overcounted overlapped areas). Now we calculate the area of the intersection of two hexagons. There are two cases : </p><p><br/><b>Case 1</b>: The hexagons are on the opposite sides</p><p>In this case, we see that the two hexagons' intersection is the middle square plus two triangles on its side. The square have area $1$. Each of the triangles are $120-30-30$, and hence its short side is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ because its longer side is $1$. Therefore, each of the small triangles have area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$, so each of the intersections have $1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$ area. Since there are $2$ pairs of hexagons on opposite side of each other, that gives a total area of $2+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.</p><p><br/><b>Case 2</b>: The hexagons are adjacent[asy] pair[] A,B; path h1, h2,h3,h4; h1 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(90))*polygon(6); h2 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(0))*rotate(90)*polygon(6); h3 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(-90))*polygon(6); h4 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(180))*rotate(90)*polygon(6); B.cyclic=true; B.push((0,0)); int indexSquare[] = sequence(4); int indexPolygon[] = sequence(12); for(int i : indexSquare){ A.push(1/sqrt(2)*dir(45+90*i)); } draw(A[0]--A[1]--A[2]--A[3]--cycle); fill(h1,green); fill(h2,red); fill(buildcycle(h2,h1),yellow); draw(h1); draw(h2); draw(h3); draw(h4); for(int i : sequence(4)) { for(int j : sequence(3)) { B.push(B[3*i+j]+((sqrt(3)-1.5)*(j-1)*(j)+4-2*sqrt(3))*dir(90*i+60+30*j*(1.5*(j-1)-1))); } } for(int i=0; i <12; ++i) { draw(shift(0.5,0.5-sqrt(3))*(B[i])--shift(0.5,0.5-sqrt(3))*(B[i + 1]),linewidth(2)); } [/asy]</p><p>In this case, their intersection is a convex hexagon. We cut it in half and we're left with a quadrilateral with two sides with length one (because it shares these sides with one of the hexagons, and for this reason the angle between the two sides is $120$ degrees) and one short side and one long side. Here, we divide the area even further. We draw a line that divide the quadrilateral into a triangle with side lengths $1$, $1$, and $\\sqrt{3}$(because it is $30-30-120$) and another triangle with unknown side lengths. Simple angle chasing yields the triangle with unknown side lengths is a $15-75-90$ triangle. If you remembered your sines and cosines, you know that $\\sin{15}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ or you can calculate it by using the fact that $\\sin{15}=\\sin{45-30}$. Also, $\\sin{75}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$. Now, because the $15-75-90$ triangle have one side with length $\\sqrt{3}$(it shares the side with the other triangle) and it corresponds to the 75 degrees angle, we have </p><p>\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\\frac{x}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}}\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}{(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})}}{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}=2\\sqrt{3}-3\\]</p><p>where $x$ denote the shorter leg of the $15-75-90$ triangle. Hence, that triangle have area </p><p>\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}-3)=\\frac{6-3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]. </p><p>The isosceles $120-30-30$ triangle obviously have area $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$, and that gives a total of $\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. We multiply that by $2$ because $\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ is only half of the intersection of the hexagons. We multiply the result by $4$ because there are $4$ pairs of adjacent hexagons. That gives $24-10\\sqrt{3}$, which is it for Case 2. </p><p><br/>Now that we got the total area of the intersection of two hexagons, we find the area of the intersection of three hexagons. Note that the intersection of any three hexagons is just the middle square plus one small triangle on the side. Again, the middle square have area $1$ and the triangle have area $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$, so the total is $1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$. We multiply that by $4\\choose3$ to get $4+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.</p><p><br/>Then, we calculate the area of the intersection of all four hexagons, which is just the middle square with area $1$. </p><p><br/>Finally, we apply PIE. The total area is </p><p>\\[6\\sqrt{3}-[(2+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3})+(24-10\\sqrt{3})]+(4+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3})-1=16\\sqrt{3}-23\\],</p><p>so our final answer is $16+3-23=\\boxed{(B)-4}$. $\\blacksquare$ ~<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/index.php/Ddk001\" title=\"Ddk001\">Ddk001</a></p>"
