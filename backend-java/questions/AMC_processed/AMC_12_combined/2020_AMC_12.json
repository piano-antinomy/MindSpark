        "<p>A quick check tells us that $(20,20)$ falls on the given line. Common sense tells us that if the slope of the original line is $1$, or 45 degrees from the horizontal, a 45 counter clockwise rotation will result in a vertical line, and the x-intercept will be $(20,0)$. Thinking of a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation as a 90 degree counter clockwise rotation that is bisected will helps in visualizing this line of reasoning.Therefore, it follows that if the original line is made steeper, then the x-intercept will move away from $(20,0)$ to the right. If the original line is made lower, then the opposite will happen. Our given line has slope $3/5$, so the answer must be $A$ or $B$. $A$ can be eliminated because an x-intercept of $(10,0)$ can only occur when the original line is horizontal.

        "<p>This solution is quite efficient and unconvoluted. Though the explanation appears long, this is only because I have tried to make it very thorough. </p><p>Because we are finding the ratios of the areas of the quadrilateral, and the octagon, let us assume, for simplicity's sake, that the octagon has side length $1$. Call $O$ the center of the octagon. Because it is a regular octagon, $\\angle AOB$ is $\\frac{360}{8}=45$. Draw the apothem, and call where it intersects $AB$, $I$. As the apothem bisects $\\angle AOB$, $\\angle AIB$ is $\\frac{45}{2}=22.5$. Then, as the apothem is perpendicular to $AB$, $\\angle IBO$ is $90-22.5=67.5$. As the apothem bisects $AB$, segment $IB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the apothem has length $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5)$. By the formula $\\text{area} = \\text{apothem} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{perimeter}}{2}$, the area of the octagon is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5) \\cdot \\frac{8}{2}$.</p><p>Now, we move on to the quadrilateral. Let us take triangle $AGH$. By the interior angle formula, $m \\angle AGH = \\frac{180 (8-2)}{8} = 135$. Because the octagon is regular, $AGH$ is isosceles, with assumed sidelength $1$. Drop an altitude from $H$ to $AG$, and call the intersection point, $P$. As $AGH$ is isosceles, this altitude bisects both segment $AG$ and angle $AHG$. Thus, the $m \\angle AHP = \\frac{135}{2} = 67.5$. Let us call the length of $AG$, which is also a side of the quadrilateral, $s$. Then, $AP$ is $\\frac{s}{2}$. Thus, $\\text{sin}(67.5) = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{1}$, so $s = 2 \\cdot \\text{sin}(67.5)$. We can do the same for each of the other sides of the quadrilateral and find that they are of the same length. One can easily see that triangle $ABC$ is congruent to triangle $AGH$. Because triangle $AGH$ is isosceles, $m \\angle HAG = \\frac{180-135}{2} = 22.5$. The same can be said of angles $BAC$. Thus, angle $CAG$, an interior angle of the quadrilateral is $90$. We can do the same for the other interior angles of $CEGA$ and find that they are also $90$. Thus, $CEGA$ is a square, so its area is $s^2 = 4 \\cdot \\text{sin}^2(67.5)$. </p><p>Now, we must find the ratios of the two areas.$\\frac{\\text{Area(quadrilateral)}}{\\text{Area(hexagon)}}  = 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{sin}^2(67.5)}{2\\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5)}  =frac{2\\cdot \\text{sin}^2(67.5)}{\\frac{\\text{sin}(67.5)}{\\text{cos}(67.5)}}   = 2\\cdot \\text{sin}(67.5) \\cdot \\text{cos}(67.5)   = \\text{sin} (135) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, the answer.</p><p>-jyatvitskiy\u00a0:)</p>",

This is because every time we reflect $T$, it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$ $0$ times or $2$ times.</p><p><br/></p><p>Case 1: $0$ reflections on $T$.</p><p><br/></p><p>In this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$, contains every multiple of $90^\\circ$ except for $0^\\circ$. We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \\equiv -a - b \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \\equiv 0^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$. That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\\circ$, then $c \\equiv -90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -180^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$, so $c = 180^\\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\\circ,90^\\circ,180^\\circ)$ yields a full rotation.</p><p>The only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\\circ$. This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\\circ,270^\\circ),(180^\\circ,180^\\circ),$ or $(270^\\circ,90^\\circ)$. However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ yields $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$.</p><p><br/></p><p>Case 2: $2$ reflections on $T$.</p><p><br/></p><p>In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$'s final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.</p><p>Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.</p><p>Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",
        "<p>As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation.</p><p>Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$, $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$, and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$, just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ($0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$. This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways.</p><p>Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$, which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways.</p><p>$6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",

Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$, this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$.</p><p><b>Proof of only-if part</b>: If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$.
