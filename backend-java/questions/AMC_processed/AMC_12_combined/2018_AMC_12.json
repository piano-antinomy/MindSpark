        "<p>This solution has a similar idea to that of above.We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$:If $a_7 = -1$, we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$'s for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$. This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$, we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$. However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$, $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$.If $a_{7}=0$, we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$, we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$. Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$. Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$, and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$. Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.If $a_{7}=1$, we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$, we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$. So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$, we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$. So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$. In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$, $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$. We can now start building up our values for $S$: $S_{0} = 2$ ($a_{0} = 0, 1$), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$. So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \\boxed{3281}$, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.~advanture</p>",

Therefore, we know that, as there are $9$ solutions for $k$, there must be $9$ solutions for $c-1$. We know that this must be a perfect square. Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$, so $c=37$. Therefore, $j=38$. Now, since $j-1=37$, by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$, so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$.</p>",

Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$, it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$, including every factor of $C-Z$. For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$, the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$, which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$. Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.)

Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \\ldots\\] in which the same result follows. </p><p>Using the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully.

Now we can find the length of BC in terms of the radius of the incircle, which will be r. Using the knowledge that $\\triangle RIB$ is right with some trigonometry, we find that $BR$ is 3r/2. We also find that $CR$ is the r, and so we can create the equation $BR$ + $CR$ = $BC$ -> 3r/2 + r = 5 -> 5r/2. We conclude r = 2. We now accept the fact that quadrilateral $BQIR$ is a kite, so $BR$ = $BQ$ = 3. We also know that O lies on $BA$ and divides $BA$ in half. Next we determine that $MQ$ = $BM$ - $BQ$ = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2. We also know that $IQ$ has a measure of 2 since it's the radius of circle I </p><p>We know very little about the placement of $M$, so we work on that. First, we can conclude that $\\triangle IOQ$ is part of $\\triangle MOI$. We guess that $M$ has to be higher up than $O$. We find the area of $\\triangle IOQ$ to be 7/2, which is the highest answer choice. I don't think that $M$ is below $\\overline{AB}$, but if it were to go past $\\overline{AB}$ then the answer would be GREATER than 7/2. This means $\\overline{QO}$ is on $\\overline{AB}$ . Therefore $\\triangle IOQ=\\triangle MOI$. The answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac72}$ .</p><p>~me</p><p>~Judokid (revisions)</p>",
        "<p>The circle with center $M$ is the $C$-mixtilinear incircle $\\omega$ of $\\triangle ABC$. Let $T$ be the intersection between $\\omega$ and the circumcircle $\\Omega$. Then, there is a homothety centered at $T$ sending $\\omega$ to $\\Omega$. As such, the tangent $\\overline{AC}$ gets sent to a parallel tangent to $\\Omega$, which thus must be the arc midpoint $M_B$ of arc ${CA}$. Thus, by inscribed angle theorem $CM_C$ and $BM_B$ intersect at $I$, so $EF$ passes through $I$ where $E$, $F$ are the tangency points of $\\omega$ with $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ by Pascal's Theorem.

Mark $M$ as the base of the altitude from $O_2$ to $P_1P_2.$ Since $\\triangle P_2O_2M$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, $O_2M = 2$ and $P_2M = 2\\sqrt{3}$. Also, since $O_1O_2 = 8$ and $O_1P_1 = 4$, we can find $P_1M = \\sqrt{8^2 - (4 + 2)^2} = 2\\sqrt{7}$. Thus, $P_1P_2 = P_1M + P_2M = 2\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{7}$. This makes \\[\\left[P_1P_2P_3\\right] = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}4\\cdot\\left(2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7\\right)^2 = 10\\sqrt 3 + 6\\sqrt 7 = \\sqrt{300} + \\sqrt{252}.\\] So, our answer is $252 + 300 = \\boxed{\\textbf{D) }552}$.</p><p>Note by diyarv:</p><p>A way to see that $P_1M = 2{\\sqrt 7}$ is through similar triangles. Call the intersection between $P_1M$ and $O_1O_2$ $S$. Since angles $\\angle{O_1P_1S}$ and $\\angle{O_2MS}$ are both right angles, and $\\angle{P_1SO_1}$ and $\\angle{MSO_2}$ are congruent, triangles $\\triangle{P_1SO_1}$ and $\\triangle{MSO_2}$ are similar by AA similarity. And, since $O_1P_1$ is $4$ and $O_2M$ is 2, the common ratio is $2$. Using the fact that $O_1S + SO_2 = 8$, we see that these lengths are $\\frac{16}{3}$ and $\\frac{8}{3}$ respectively. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we see that $P_1S$ and $SP_2$ are $\\frac{2\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ and $\\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ respectively, giving us a sum of $2\\sqrt{7}$.</p><p>A better note on why $P_1M = \\sqrt{8^2 - (4 + 2)^2}$:</p><p>This is more easily seen by translating $O_1O_2$ so that $O_2$ is mapped to $M$ and the resulting $O_1\u2019$ remains collinear with the original $O_1$ and $P_1$. This forms a right triangle, with leg $O_1\u2019 P = 4+2 = 6$ and hypotenuse $O_1\u2019O_2 = 8$. Therefore $P_1M = \\sqrt{8^2 - (4 + 2)^2}$</p>",
        "<p>Let $O_i$ be the center of circle $\\omega_i$ for $i=1,2,3$, and let $K$ be the intersection of lines $O_1P_1$ and $O_2P_2$. Because $\\angle P_1P_2P_3 = 60^\\circ$, it follows that $\\triangle P_2KP_1$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. Let $x=P_1K$; then $P_2K = 2x$ and $P_1P_2 = x \\sqrt 3$. The Law of Cosines in $\\triangle O_1KO_2$ gives \\[8^2 = (x+4)^2 + (2x-4)^2 - 2(x+4)(2x-4)\\cos 60^\\circ,\\]which simplifies to $3x^2 - 12x - 16 = 0$. The positive solution is $x = 2 + \\tfrac23\\sqrt{21}$. Then $P_1P_2 = x\\sqrt 3 = 2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7$, and so the area of $\\triangle P_1P_2P_3$ is \\[\\frac{\\sqrt 3}4\\cdot\\left(2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7\\right)^2 = 10\\sqrt 3 + 6\\sqrt 7 = \\sqrt{300} + \\sqrt{252}.\\]The requested sum is $300 + 252 = \\boxed{552}$.</p>",
