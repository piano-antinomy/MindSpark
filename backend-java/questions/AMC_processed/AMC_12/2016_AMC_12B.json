      "solutions": [

From 8, you need two numbers that add up too 8, that when you add 2 to both of them are at a 1:2 ratio. Brute force says these numbers are 6 and 2. 6 + 2 = 12, and (6+2) = 2(2+2).

The first and third part of the condition are already met by our wlog, so we just need to count of number of ways the second condition is true (a team in X beats a team in Y).

Looking at the answer choices, all of the intervals are less than $1000,$ so we know that (the minimum value of) $n+6$ is thereby either $101, 101 \\times 3,$ or $101 \\times 9.$ Testing, we see that $n+6 = 303$ gives $n = 297 = 3^3 \\times 11,$ which in fact is a divisor of $999 \\times 1001$ while not being a divisor of $999.$ Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}}.$</p><p>~ Professor-Mom</p>"
