        "<p>Let $r$ be the magnitude of $a+bi$. Notice that $r$ must be either $0$ or $1$ for this to be true, as shown in the above solutions. We know this because we are taking magnitude to the $2003$rd power, and if the magnitude of $a+bi$ is larger than $1$, it will increase and if it is smaller than $1$ it will decrease. However, the magnitude on the RHS is still $r$, so this is not possible.

This has solution of $\\theta = 0$. This would represent the number $1+0i$, with conjugate $1-0i$. This works because the magnitude is the same and the angle is nothing anyways. We multiply angle by $2002$ through De Moivre's Theorem and also we do $-\\theta$ because it is a reflection, angles therefore is negative.</p><p>We then write:</p><p>$\\cos(2002 \\theta) = \\cos(360-\\theta)$ which has solution of $\\theta = \\frac{360}{2003}$. </p><p>We can also write:</p><p>$\\cos(2002 \\theta) = \\cos(720-\\theta)$ which has solution $\\theta = \\frac{720}{2003}$.</p><p>We notice that it is simply headed upwards and the answer is of the form $\\frac{720}{2003} n$, where n is some integer from $0$ to infinity, inclusive.</p><p>Well wait, it repeats itself $n=2003$, that is $360$ which is also $0$!
