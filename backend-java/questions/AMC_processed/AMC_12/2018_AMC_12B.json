Now we know that all triangles $ABC$ will be a right triangle. We also know that the closed curve will simply be a circle with radius equal to the centroid of each triangle. We can now pick any arbitrary triangle, calculate its centroid, and the plug it in to the area formula. Using a $45^\\circ$-$45^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle in conjunction with the properties of a centroid, we can quickly see that the length of the centroid is $4$ now we can plug it in to the area formula where we get $16\\pi\\approx\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 50}$.</p>"

Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$, so $c=37$. Therefore, $j=38$. Now, since $j-1=37$, by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$, so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$.</p>",

Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$, it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$, including every factor of $C-Z$. For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$, the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$, which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$. Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.)
