It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.</p><p><br/>The area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$. Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$.</p><p><br/>The area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$.
