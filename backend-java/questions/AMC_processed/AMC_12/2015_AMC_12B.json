        "<p>We can represent each rearrangement as a permutation of the six elements $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ in cycle notation. Note that any such permutation cannot have a 1-cycle, so the only possible types of permutations are 2,2,2-cycles, 4,2-cycles, 3,3-cycles, and 6-cycles. We deal with each case separately.</p><p>For 2,2,2-cycles, suppose that one of the 2-cycles switches the people across from each other, i.e. $(14)$, $(25)$, or $(36)$. WLOG, we may assume it to be $(14)$. Then we could either have both of the other 2-cycles be across from each other, giving the permutation $(14)(25)(36)$ or else neither of the other 2-cycles is across from each other, in which case the only possible permutation is $(14)(26)(35)$. This can happen for $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well. So since the first permutation is not counted twice, we find a total of $1+3=4$ permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles where at least one of the 2-cycles switches people diametrically opposite from each other. Otherwise, since the elements in a 2-cycle cannot differ by 1, 3, or 5 mod 6, they must differ by 2 or 4 mod 6, i.e. they must be of the same parity. But since we have three odd and three even elements, this is impossible. Hence there are exactly 4 such permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles.</p><p>For 4,2-cycles, we assume for the moment that 1 is part of the 2-cycle. Then the 2-cycle can be $(13)$, $(15)$, or $(14)$. The first two are essentially the same by symmetry, and we must arrange the elements 2, 4, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. However, 5 must have two neighbors that are not next to it, which is impossible, hence the first two cases yield no permutations. If the 2-cycle is $(14)$, then we must arrange the elements 2, 3, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. Then 2 must have the neighbors 5 and 6. We find that the 4-cycles $(2536)$ and $(2635)$ satisfy the desired properties, yielding the permutations $(14)(2536)$ and $(14)(2635)$. This can be done for the 2-cycles $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well, so we find a total of 6 such permutations that are 4,2-cycles.</p><p>For 3,3-cycles, note that if 1 neighbor 4, then the third element in the cycle will neighbor one of 1 and 4, so this is impossible. Therefore, the 3-cycle containing 1 must consist of elements 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, we obtain the four 3,3-cycles $(135)(246)$, $(153)(246)$, $(135)(264)$, and $(153)(264)$.</p><p>For 6-cycles, note that the neighbors of 1 can be 3 and 4, 3 and 5, or 4 and 5. In the first case, we may assume that it looks like $(314\\dots)$ -- the form $(413\\dots)$ is also possible but equivalent to this case. Then we must place the elements 2, 5, and 6. Note that 5 and 6 cannot go together, so 2 must go in between them. Also, 5 cannot neighbor 4, so we are left with one possibility, namely $(314625)$, which has an analogous possibility $(413526)$. In the second case, we assume that it looks like $(315\\dots)$. The 2 must go next to the 5, and the 6 must go last (to neighbor the 3), so the only possibility here is $(315246)$, with the analogous possibility $(513642)$. In the final case, we may assume that it looks like $(415\\dots)$. Then the 2 and 3 cannot go together, so the 6 must go in between them. Therefore, the only possibility is $(415362)$, with the analogous possibility $(514263)$. We have covered all possibilities for 6-cycles, and we have found 6 of them.</p><p>Therefore, there are $4+6+4+6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 20}$ such permutations.</p>",
        "<p>Notice the question is not any different than counting the cases if someone either stays put or moves one seat to the left or right (as in the above solution).

B can move to the left (to A's seat) or move to the right to C's seat. If B moves to C's seat, C cannot cancel the loop by going to A's seat, since we set the restriction as each person can only move ONE seat to the left/right. The only way to finish this process would be C moving to D, D moving to E, E moving to F, and F moving to A, achieving FABCDE as a case. Of course, A can move left and the same loop would occur but in the opposite direction (BCDEFA). Thus, we achieve two cases.</p><p>Case 3: The movement of seats cancel out each other.If A moves to B's seat, B can move to A's seat, canceling the cycle. In this case, we would look to C, where this same thing could happen (note, however, that if C moves to D's seat, D cannot move to E's seat as the loop would be unachievable; furthermore, note that C cannot move to B's seat if A is already there since that would mean A would have to move to C's seat which is restricted).</p><p>We can count these cases by grouping each pair and then doing subcases:</p><p>Subcase 1: AB CD and EF are grouped.Here we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, but they cannot all stay put since we've already counted that possibility in Case 1, and thus there are 7 cases here.</p><p>Subcase 2: BC DE and FA are grouped.Here again, we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, and then subtract the overcounted case to get 7 cases.</p><p>Subcase 3: There is overlap so that two people do not change.If A and B change seats, D and E could change seats, and this would not have been counted by the previous groupings (since its an odd parity grouping + an even parity grouping). Count this simply by listing out the cases, or notice that this just means the two people sitting three seats away not moving. There are three cases of that happening (A and D not moving, B and E not moving, and C and F not moving).</p><p>Look back at all our cases. Sum them up to get $1+2+7+7+3 = 20$</p><p>iron</p>"

Thus, $AR = 57$, $BR = 57+39 = 96$, $CR = 7$, $DR = 39-7 = 32$, implying$AR+BR+CR+DR = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }192}$.</p><p>~sml1809</p>"

        "<p>Here is an alternate solution that does not use complex numbers:</p><p>The distance from $P_{2015}$ to $P_0$ can be evaluated using the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/index.php/Pythagorean_theorem\" title=\"Pythagorean theorem\">Pythagorean theorem</a>. Assuming $P_0$ lies at the origin, we can calculate the distance the bee traveled to $P_{2015}$ by evaluating the distance the bee traveled in the x-direction and the y-direction. Let's start by summing each movement:</p><p>$x=1\\cos{0}+2\\cos{30}+3\\cos{60}+\\cdots+2014\\cos{270}+2015\\cos{300}$</p><p>A movement of $p$ units at $q$ degrees is the same thing as a movement of $-p$ units at $q-180$ degrees, so we can adjust all the cosines with arguments greater than $180$ as follows:</p><p>$x=1\\cos{0}+2\\cos{30}+3\\cos{60}+4\\cos{90}+5\\cos{120}+6\\cos{150}-7\\cos{0}-8\\cos{30}-\\cdots-2015\\cos{120}$</p><p>Grouping terms with like-cosines and factoring out the cosines:</p><p>$x=(1-7+13-\\cdots+2005-2011)\\cos{0}+\\cdots+(6-12+18-\\cdots-2004+2010)\\cos{150}$</p><p>Each sum in the parentheses has $336$ terms (except the very last one, which has $335$). By pairing each term, we see there are $\\frac{336}{2}$ pairs of $-6$. Therefore, each sum equals $168\\cdot-6=-1008$ except the very last sum, which has $167$ pairs of $-6$ plus an extra 2010 and equals $167\\cdot-6+2010=1008$. Plugging in these values:</p><p>$x=-1008\\cos{0}-1008\\cos{30}-1008\\cos{60}-1008\\cos{90}-1008\\cos{120}+1008\\cos{150}$$x=1008(-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}-0+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})=-1008(1+\\sqrt{3})$</p><p>We can find how far the bee traveled in the y-direction using the same logic as above, we arrive at the sum:</p><p>$y=-1008\\sin{0}-1008\\sin{30}-1008\\sin{60}-1008\\sin{90}-1008\\sin{120}+1008\\sin{150}$</p><p>$y=1008(0-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+\\frac{1}{2})=-1008(1+\\sqrt{3})$</p><p>Finally, we use the Pythagorean to find the distance from $P_0$.

        "<p>We first notice that if the bee is turning 30 degrees each turn, it will take 12 turns to be looking in the same direction when the bee initially left. This means we simply need to answer the question; how far will the bee be when the bee is facing in the same direction? </p><p><br/>First we use the fact that after 3 turns, the bee will be facing in a direction perpendicular to the the initial direction. From here we can draw a perpendicular from $P_2$ to the line $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ intersecting a point $C_0$. We will also place the point $C_1$ at the intersection of $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ and $\\overline{P_3P_4}$. In addition, the point $C_2$ is placed at the perpendicular dropped from $P_2$ to the line $\\overline{P_3C_1}$. We will also set the distance $\\overline{P_0P_1} = n$ and thus $\\overline{P_1P_2} = n+1$. With this perpendicular we see that the triangle $\\triangle{P_1P_2C_0}$ is a 30-60-90 triangle. This means that the length $\\overline{P_1C_0} = \\frac{(n+1)\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the length $\\overline{C_1C_2} = \\frac{n+1}{2}$. We can also see that the triangle $\\triangle{P_2C_1P_3}$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and thus $\\overline{C_0C_1} = \\frac{n+2}{2}$ and $\\overline{C_2P_3} = \\frac{(n+2)\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Now if we continue this across all $P_i$ and set the point $P_0$ to the coordinates $(0, 0)$. As you can see, we are inherently putting a “box” around the figure. Doing similar calculations for all four “sides” of this spiral we get that the length</p><p>\\[\\overline{P_0C_1} = n + \\frac{(n+1)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{2}\\],  \\[\\overline{C_1C_4} = \\frac{(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n+2)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+3) + \\frac{(n+4)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+5}{2}\\], \\[\\overline{C_4C_7} = \\frac{(n+4)}{2} + \\frac{(n+5)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+6) + \\frac{(n+7)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+8}{2}\\], \\[\\overline{C_7C_{10}} = \\frac{(n+7)}{2} + \\frac{(n+8)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+9) + \\frac{(n+10)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+11}{2}\\], and finally \\[\\overline{C_{10}P_{12}} = \\frac{(n+10)}{2} + \\frac{(n+11)\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]. </p><p>Here the point $C_4$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_3P_4}$ and $\\overline{P_6P_7}$. The point $C_7$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_6P_7}$ and $\\overline{P_9P_{10}}$. Finally, the point $C_10$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_{9}P_{10}}$ and $\\overline{P_{12}P_{13}}$. Note that our spiral stops at $P_{12}$ before the next spiral starts. Calculating the offset from the x and the y direction, we see that the offset, or the new point $P_{12}$, is $({-6}, {-6}-12 \\sqrt{3})$. This is an interesting property that the points’ coordinate changes by a constant offset no matter what $n$ is. Since the new point’s subscript changes by 12 each time and we see that 2016 is divisible by 12, the point $P_{2016} = ({-168} \\cdot {6}, {168} \\cdot ({-6} \\sqrt{3} {-12}))$. Using similar 30-60-90 triangle properties, we see that $P_{2015} = ({-6} \\cdot 168-1008 \\sqrt{3}, 168({-6} \\sqrt{3} - 12) + 1008)$. Using the distance formula, the numbers cancel out nicely (1008 is divisible by 168, so take 168 when using the distance formula) and we see that the final answer is $(1008)(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2})$ which gives us a final answer of $\\boxed{2024}$.</p><p>-bowmanrocks32</p><p><br/></p>",
