She fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. What fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>The first three glasses each have a full glass. Let's assume that each glass has \"1 unit\" of juice. It won't matter exactly how much juice everyone has because we're dealing with ratios, and that wouldn't affect our answer. The fourth glass has a glass that is one third. So the total amount of juice will be $1+1+1+\\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{10}{3}$. If we divide the total amount of juice by 4, we get $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, which should be the amount of juice in each glass. This means that each of the first three glasses will have to contribute $1 - \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac16}.$ to the fourth glass.</p><p>~Sir Ian Seo the Great &amp; lprado</p>",
        "<p>Given that the first three glasses are full and the fourth is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, let's represent their contents with a common denominator, which we'll set as 6.

Pouring $\\frac{1}{6}$ from each of the first three glasses will make them all $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ full. Thus, all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.

Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values. </p><p>We start our work on representing $j$: the powers of $5$, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$. Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$. </p><p>Suppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$. These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$, this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$. </p><p>Now we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$'s and the number of $5$'s our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?</p><p>In the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$. However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$, if we choose a $6$. The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$, which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$. </p><p>We now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$. For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$. Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$.</p><p>Now if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$, which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$. Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$. Therefore the powers of $2$, and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$, so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$. </p><p>Now to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$s and $j$s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$: the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$, since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.</p><p>\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j\\]</p><p>We start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$. Set $i$ to $0$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$, then set $i$ to $1$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$, etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Therefore the left summation evaluates to \\[\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Now we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$. This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$. Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$, the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$.</p><p>In the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$. Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$, so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$. We can rearrange this as $((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)$</p><p>\\[= \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1\\]</p><p>We can write this in easier terms as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k$\\[=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}\\]\\[= \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\\]</p><p>We multiply this by $3$ to obtain that \\[\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Thus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ is:\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\\[= \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)\\]\\[= \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}\\]</p><p>Now most of the work is done. We set this equal to $936$ and prime factorize. $936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$, so $(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$. Clearly $13$ cannot be anything squared and $2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ is a perfect square, so $n+2 = 13$ and $n = 11 = \\boxed{A}$</p><p><br/></p><p>~KingRavi</p>",

Other transformation like 1*6*6=3*3*4 can be viewed as a 1*6=2*3 combined with a 2*6=3*4. </p><p>So we can transform any given combination into a \"normallised\" combination in this way: step 1, if there are 1 and 6, then transorm them into 2*3; step 2, if there are both 1 and 4, then transform them into a 2*2; step3: if there are both 2 and 6, then transform them into 3*4.

If we roll $5$ once, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-1}$. In general, if we roll $5$ $i$ times, then the number of distinct products is equal to $b_{n-i}$. Between the different cases of how many times we roll $5$, the products are guaranteed to be distinct. This is because in their prime factorizations, the powers of $5$ are different, and by the Fundmamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the products must be different as well.</p><p>In other words, we have found:\\[a_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i\\]</p><p>Now let us focus on $b_n$, and from now on, until otherwise specified, the die will refer to the modified, 5-sided die.In these $n$ rolls of the dice, if we roll $3$ zero times and $6$ zero times, then the product must be a power of $2$. It can range from $2^0$ to $4^n$, which is equal to $2^{2n}$. Therefore, there are $2n+1$ possible products.

Thus:</p><p><br/>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(5 \\cdot[DKT]-5 \\cdot [PFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK])\\]</p><p>We also know that since we dropped an altitude from $O$ to $U$, the area of $\\triangle ODU$ must be half of a fifth of the total area of the pentagon.

Therefore, if we can write the areas of the latter two triangles as a ratio of the first triangle, we can express the whole equation in terms of $[ODU]$, and by extension $[ABCDE]$, which we know.

These sides are $DV$ and $FU$, respectively. </p><p>First, $\\frac{s}{2} = OD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})$, so $OD = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})$. Then notice that $DV = \\frac{OD}{2}$ because we have to fold $D$ to hit $O$, so the folding crease has to be exactly halfway between $O$ and $D$. Therefore, \\[DV = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{DU}{DV} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})} = 2 \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})\\]</p><p>Now the ratio between the area of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their analogous side lengths.

Calculating $FU$ is slightly tricker. First, we find $TD$: $TD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ}) = DV = \\frac{s}{4} sec^54^{\\circ}) \\implies TD = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})$. Now since $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles, $TD = DK$ and $UK = DK-DU = TD-DU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})-\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (sec^2(54^{\\circ})-2) = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1)$.</p><p>Now $FU = UK \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ}) \\implies FU \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1) \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ})$. Now note that $tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x) = 1$ because opposite over adjacent cancel each other out in a right triangle. Thus, $FU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))$</p><p>Now, \\[\\frac{DU}{FU} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))} = \\frac{2}{tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ})}\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies \\frac{[DU]}{[FU]} = \\frac{4}{(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2} \\implies 10 \\cdot [FU] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>Now we go back to our first equation and plug in our values:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = 1+\\sqrt{5}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})+\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (4-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2)\\]</p><p>Note $(tan(x)-tan(90-x))^2 = tan^2(x)-2 \\cdot tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x)+tan^2(90-x) = tan^2(x)-2+tan^2(90-x)$.</p><p>Also note that $tan^2(x)+1 = sec^2(x)$.Thus \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2+(-1)+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) \\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\].</p><p>Now all that remains is to find $tan^2(36^{\\circ})$. We can use the tan addition formula to find the general form of $tan(5x)$ or remember question 25 from this year's AMC 12A. We have that \\[tan(5x) = \\frac{5tan(x)-10tan^3(x)+tan^5(x)}{1-10tan^2(x)+5tan^4(x)}\\]. </p><p>Plug in $x=36$. Then we have \\[tan(180^{\\circ}) = \\frac{5tan(36^{\\circ})-10tan^3(36^{\\circ})+tan^5(36^{\\circ})}{1-10tan^2(36^{\\circ})+5tan^4(36^{\\circ})}\\]Now let $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$. We have the equation \\[\\frac{5y-10y^3+y^5}{1-10y^2+5y^4} = 0 \\implies 5y-10y^3+y^5 = 0\\]\\[\\implies 5-10y^2+y^4 = 0 \\implies 5-10z+z^2 = 0\\]Where we let $z = y^2$. Using the quadratic formula, we have \\[z = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\\]Now since $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$, $z = tan^2(36^{\\circ})$, which is what we were looking for. Notice that $tan(0^{\\circ}) = 0$ and $tan(45^{\\circ}) = 1$, so $tan(36^{\\circ})$ is between $0$ and $1$, and so is it's square. Thus $z = 5 - 2\\sqrt{5}$, not the other root.</p><p>Finally:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+5-2\\sqrt{5})\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (6-2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}-4}{4} = \\sqrt{5}-1\\]</p><p>Therefore, \\[[FGHIJ] = \\sqrt{5}-1 = \\boxed{B}\\]</p><p><br/>~KingRavi</p>",
