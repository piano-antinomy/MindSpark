For example, if there were $7$ terms, since $\\frac{7*8}{2}$ is not of the form $n(n+1)$, you cannot cancel all the $x$s.

We will consider each individually:Identity: maps a quadrilateral with sides $a,b,c,d$ in that order to $a,b,c,d$. Obviously all members of the set of quadrilaterals are fixed points, for a total of $2255$.Rotation by one: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $b,c,d,a$. For this to have a fixed point we need $a=b,b=c,c=d,d=a$, so the only quadrilateral that is a fixed point is the square with side length $8$, for a total of $1$.Rotation by two: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $c,d,a,b$. For this to be a fixed point we need $a=c$ and $b=d$. Thus the quadrilateral is of the form $x,y,x,y$—a rectangle. We can count that there are $15$ rectangle cases, namely $(a, b, c, d) = \\{ (1, 15, 1, 15), (2, 14, 2, 14), \\cdots, (15, 1, 15, 1)  \\}$.Rotation by three: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $d,a,b,c$. Similarly to the rotation by one case, there is one fixed point here.Summing up, we get that the total number of groups is $2255+1+15+1=2272$. Since there are $4$ members of the group our final answer is $\\frac{2272}{4}=\\boxed{568}$ total orbits of the set of quadrilaterals, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$.</p>"
