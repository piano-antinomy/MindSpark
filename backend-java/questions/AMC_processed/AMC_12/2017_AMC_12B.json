        "<p>First, remove all the 90s, since they make no impact. So, we have numbers from $1$ to $10$. Then, $5$ is the 7th number. Let the sum of the first $6$ numbers be $k$.

In order for the first $5$ numbers to sum to a multiple of $5$, the sixth number must also be a multiple of $5$, since $30$ is a multiple of $5$. Thus, the only option is the sixth number is $10$, which gives $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$</p><p>~ firebolt360</p>",
        "<p>Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.</p><p>From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$. </p><p>The average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$.However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)</p><p>Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$.Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.</p>",

Let $m$ be Isabella's average after $5$ tests, and let $a$ be her sixth test score. $5m+a= 6\\cdot95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, so $a$ is a multiple of $5$. Since $100$ is the only choice that is a multiple of $5$, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $T$ be the total sum of Isabella's first five test scores, and let $S$ be her score on the sixth test. It follows that $T\\equiv 0\\pmod {5}$, $T+S\\equiv 0\\pmod {6}$, and $T+S+95\\equiv 0\\pmod {7}$, since at each step, her average score was an integer. Using the last equivalence, $T+S\\equiv -95\\equiv 3\\pmod{7}$, so we have a system of equivalences for $T+S$. Solving this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get $T+S\\equiv (0)(7)(1)+(3)(6)(-1) \\equiv -18 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{42}$.</p><p>Now let's put a bound on $T$.

However, $95-7=88$ and $95+7=102$ clearly cannot be $a_6$ since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, $a_6$ must be 95. Additionally, $a_5$ cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, $a_5$ should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for $a_5$. Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from $a_5$.

The coordinates of the triangle are $\\{(\\frac{a}{a^2+1}, \\frac{a^2}{a^2+1}), (a,1), (\\frac1a, 0)\\}$, so the area is </p><p>\\[\\frac12 |\\frac{a^3}{a^2+1} + \\frac1a - \\frac{a}{a^2+1} - \\frac{a}{a^2+1}| = \\frac12 |\\frac{a^3-2a}{a^2+1} + \\frac1a|\\]\\[= \\frac12 |\\frac{a^4-2a^2}{a(a^2+1)} + \\frac{a^2+1}{a(a^2+1)}| = \\frac12 \\frac{a^4-a^2+1}{a(a^2+1)}\\]Finally, we use the property that the ratio of areas equals $17$ \\[\\frac{\\frac12}{\\frac12} \\frac{\\frac{a^4-a^2+1}{a(a^2+1)}}{\\frac{a}{a^2+1}} = 17 \\Rightarrow \\frac{a^4-a^2+1}{a^2} = 17 \\Rightarrow a^4-18a^2+1 = 0\\]\\[a^2 = 9+4\\sqrt{5} = (2+\\sqrt{5})^2 \\Longrightarrow a = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 2+\\sqrt{5}}\\]</p><p>~Zeric</p>",
        "<p>This solution involves proving $\\triangle AED \\sim \\triangle CEB$.</p><p>Let $E'$ be the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$. Label points $F$ and $G$ the same way as $\\textbf{Solution 3}$.</p><p><br/>$\\angle AE'D = \\angle CE'B = \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\angle AFE$. Additionally, $\\frac{E'D}{FE} = \\frac{E'D}{E'G} = \\frac{AE'}{AF}$, so $\\triangle AFE \\sim \\triangle AE'D$ by SAS. Therefore, $\\angle BAC = \\angle FAE + \\angle EAE' = \\angle E'AD + \\angle EAE' = \\angle EAD$.</p><p><br/>Next, $\\angle AFE = \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\angle EGD$ because $FG \\parallel BC$.

        "<p>Another way to find the average number of teams in a group of 9 or 8 people is as follows:</p><p>Let there be $T$ teams. There are $\\binom{n}{5}$ total possible teams. So, the probability of any 5 people being a team is $\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}}$. There are $\\binom{9}{5}$ possible teams in a group of 9. So, on average, there will be \\[\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{9}{5}\\]teams in any group of 9 people. Similarly, on average, there will be\\[\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{8}{5}\\]teams in any group of 8 people. So,\\begin{align*}\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{T}{\\binom{n}{5}} \\binom{8}{5}} \\implies&amp; \\binom{9}{5}\\binom{8}{5} T^2 = \\binom{n}{5}^2 \\\\\\implies&amp; 84T = \\binom{n}{5}\\end{align*}Therefore $84 \\mid \\binom{n}{5}$ and proceed as shown in solution 1.</p><p>FYI, to find n such that $32 \\mid n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$ without bashing everything:Clearly $n \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\pmod{32}$ works. Then, do cases.</p><p>Case 1: $4 \\mid n$.This will always work, as $4 \\mid n$, $4 \\mid n-4$, and $2 \\mid n-2$, so $4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 32 \\mid n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$. So, \\[n \\equiv 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 \\pmod{32}\\]are also solutions.</p><p>Case 2: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$Then $n-4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ as well. $n$ and $n-4$ can only contribute one 2 each, since $4 \\nmid n, n-4$. We need a factor of $2^3$ in $n-2$ then. So, $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. Then, we get \\[n \\equiv 2, 10, 18, 26 \\pmod{32}\\].</p><p>Case 3: $4 \\nmid n$We can only get twos from $n-1$ and $n-3$. Note that one of them can only contribute a single factor of 2, because otherwise $4 \\mid n-1$ and $4 \\mid n-3$, so $n$ has a remainder of both 1 and 3 mod 4, which is impossible. So, one must have a factor of 16. We get $n \\equiv 1, 3 \\pmod{16}$ so \\[n \\equiv 1, 3, 17, 19 \\pmod{32}\\]</p><p>In all, we get the solutions\\[n \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28 \\pmod{32}\\]</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Crazyvideogamez\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrazyVideoGamez</a></p>"
