        "<p>It is possible to solve this problem using elementary counting methods. This solution proceeds by a cleaner generating function.</p><p>We note that $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$ both lie on the imaginary axis and each of the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(\\pm 1\\pm i)$ have length $\\frac{1}{2}$ and angle of odd multiples of $\\pi/4$, i.e. $\\pi/4,3\\pi/4,5\\pi/4,7\\pi/4$. When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is $6^{12}$. Now we count the number of good combinations.</p><p>We first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have $n$ of the numbers $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$; then we must have $\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12-n}=1 \\Longrightarrow n=8$. Having $n=8$ will take care of the length of the product; now we need to deal with the angle.</p><p>We require $\\sum\\theta\\equiv\\pi \\mod 2\\pi$. Letting $z$ be $e^{i\\pi/4}$, we see that the angles we have available are $\\{z^1,z^2,z^3,z^5,z^6,z^7\\}$, where we must choose exactly 8 angles from the set $\\{z^2,z^6\\}$ and exactly 4 from the set $\\{z^1,z^3,z^5,z^7\\}$. If we found a good combination where we had $a_i$ of each angle $z^i$, then the amount this would contribute to our count would be $\\binom{12}{4,8}\\cdot\\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\cdot\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}$. We want to add these all up. We proceed by generating functions.</p><p>Consider \\[(t_2x^2+t_6x^6)^8(t_1x^1+t_3x^3+t_5x^5+t_7x^7)^4.\\] The expansion will be of the form $\\sum_i\\left(\\sum_{\\sum a=i} \\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}{t_1}^{a_1}{t_2}^{a_2}{t_3}^{a_3}{t_5}^{a_5}{t_6}^{a_6}{t_7}^{a_7}x^i \\right)$. Note that if we reduced the powers of $x$ mod $8$ and fished out the coefficient of $x^4$ and plugged in $t_i=1\\ \\forall\\,i$ (and then multiplied by $\\binom{12}{4,8}$) then we would be done. Since plugging in $t_i=1$ doesn't affect the $x$'s, we do that right away. The expression then becomes \\[x^{20}(1+x^4)^8(1+x^2+x^4+x^6)^4=x^{20}(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\] where the last equality is true because we are taking the powers of $x$ mod $8$. Let $[x^n]f(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in $f(x)$. Note $[x^4] x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=[x^0](1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4$. We use the roots of unity filter, which states \\[\\text{terms of }f(x)\\text{ that have exponent congruent to }k\\text{ mod }n=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{f(z^mx)}{z^{mk}},\\] where $z=e^{i\\pi/n}$. In our case $k=0$, so we only need to find the average of the $f(z^mx)$'s.\\begin{align*} z^0 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^1 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^2 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^3 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^4 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^5 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^6 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^7 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4. \\end{align*}We plug in $x=1$ and take the average to find the sum of all coefficients of $x^{\\text{multiple of 8}}$. Plugging in $x=1$ makes all of the above zero except for $z^0$ and $z^4$. Averaging, we get $2^{14}$. Now the answer is simply \\[\\frac{\\binom{12}{4,8}}{6^{12}}\\cdot 2^{14}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}.\\]</p>",
        "<p>By changing $z_1$ to $-z_1$, we can give a bijection between cases where $P=-1$ and cases where $P=1$, so we'll just find the probability that $P=\\pm 1$ and divide by $2$ in the end. Multiplying the hexagon's vertices by $i$ doesn't change $P$, and switching any $z_j$ with $-z_j$ doesn't change the property $P=\\pm 1$, so the probability that $P=\\pm1$ remains the same if we only select our $z_j$'s at random from\\[\\left\\{a= \\sqrt 2,\\quad b=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\\quad c=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i)\\right\\}.\\]Since $|a|=\\sqrt2$ and $|b|=|c|=\\frac12$, we must choose $a$ exactly $8$ times to make $|P|=1$. To ensure $P$ is real, we must either choose $b$ $4$ times, $c$ $4$ times, or both $b$ and $c$ $2$ times. This gives us a total of \\[2\\binom{12}{4}+\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{10}{2}=(12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9)\\left(\\frac1{12}+\\frac14\\right)=(2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5\\cdot 11)\\frac13\\]good sequences $z_1,\\dots,z_{12}$, and hence the final result is\\[\\frac12\\cdot \\frac{2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{12}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}.\\]</p>",
        "<p>We use generating functions and a roots of unity filter.Notice that all values in $V$ are eighth roots of unity multiplied by a constant.

To have $P=-1$, we must have that $|P|=1$, so eight of the $(z_i)$ must belong to \\[\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}\\]and the other four must belong to \\[\\left \\{ \\frac{x}{2},\\frac{x^3}{2},\\frac{x^5}{2},\\frac{x^7}{2} \\right\\}\\]So, we write the generating function \\[\\left (x^2 +x^6 \\right )^8 \\left (x+x^3+x^5+x^7 \\right )^4\\]to describe the product. Note that this assumes that the $(z_i)$ that belong to $\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}$ come first, so we will need to multiply by $\\binom{12}{4}$ at the end. We now apply a roots of unity filter to find the sum of the coefficients of the exponents that are $4\\pmod{8}$, or equivalently the coefficients of the powers that are multiples of $8$ of the following function:\\[P(x)=\\left (x^2 +x^6 \\right )^8 \\left (x+x^3+x^5+x^7 \\right )^4x^4\\]Let $\\zeta=e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}$.

So, we get an answer of $\\frac{2^{16}+2^{16}}{8\\cdot 6^{12}}=\\frac{2^{14}}{6^{12}}=\\frac{2^2}{3^{10}}$. But wait!
