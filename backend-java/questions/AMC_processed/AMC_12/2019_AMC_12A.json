        "<p>First of all, $d$ obviously has to be smaller than $M$, since when calculating $M$, we must take into account the $29$s, $30$s, and $31$s. So we can eliminate choices $B$ and $C$. Since there are $365$ total entries, the median, $M$, must be the $183\\text{rd}$ one, at which point we note that $12 \\cdot 15$ is $180$, so $16$ has to be the median (because $183$ is between $12 \\cdot 15 + 1 = 181$ and $12 \\cdot 16 = 192$).

Hence, since we in fact have $29$'s, $30$'s, and $31$'s, the mean has to be higher than $14.5$. On the other hand, since there are fewer $29$'s, $30$'s, and $31$'s than the rest of the numbers, the mean has to be lower than $16$ (the median).

The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$.

        "<p>The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$. After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$, so the inradius is $4$. Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$. Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$. The distance $OA$ is $6$, because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$, because it is the radius of the incircle.

We also find that it seems that all other values of $n$ where $n$ is a square of a prime work. So we get $50-15-1=\\boxed{34}$ and that happens to be right. </p><p>~<a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=BS2012&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"BS2012 (page does not exist)\">BS2012</a>~mathboy282</p>"

        "<p>For all nonnegative integers $n$, let $\\angle C_nA_nB_n=x_n$, $\\angle A_nB_nC_n=y_n$, and $\\angle B_nC_nA_n=z_n$.</p><p>Note that quadrilateral $A_0B_0A_1B_1$ is cyclic since $\\angle A_0A_1B_0=\\angle A_0B_1B_0=90^\\circ$; thus, $\\angle A_0A_1B_1=\\angle A_0B_0B_1=90^\\circ-x_0$. By a similar argument, $\\angle A_0A_1C_1=\\angle A_0C_0C_1=90^\\circ-x_0$. Thus, $x_1=\\angle A_0A_1B_1+\\angle A_0A_1C_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$. By a similar argument, $y_1=180^\\circ-2y_0$ and $z_1=180^\\circ-2z_0$.</p><p>Therefore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $x_n=180^\\circ-2x_{n-1}$ (identical recurrence relations can be derived for $y_n$ and $z_n$). To find an explicit form for this recurrence, we guess that the constant term is related exponentially to $n$ (and the coefficient of $x_0$ is $(-2)^n$). Hence, we let $x_n=pq^n+r+(-2)^nx_0$. We will solve for $p$, $q$, and $r$ by iterating the recurrence to obtain $x_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$, $x_2=4x_0-180^\\circ$, and $x_3=540-8x_0$. Letting $n=1,2,3$ respectively, we have \\begin{align} pq+r&=180 \\\\ pq^2+r&=-180 \\\\ pq^3+r&=540 \\end{align}</p><p>Subtracting $(1)$ from $(3)$, we have $pq(q^2-1)=360$, and subtracting $(1)$ from $(2)$ gives $pq(q-1)=-360$. Dividing these two equations gives $q+1=-1$, so $q=-2$. Substituting back, we get $p=-60$ and $r=60$.</p><p>We will now prove that for all positive integers $n$, $x_n=-60(-2)^n+60+(-2)^nx_0=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$ via induction. Clearly the base case of $n=1$ holds, so it is left to prove that $x_{n+1}=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60$ assuming our inductive hypothesis holds for $n$. Using the recurrence relation, we have \\begin{align*} x_{n+1}&=180-2x_n \\\\ &=180-2((-2)^n(x_0-60)+60) \\\\ &=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60 \\end{align*}</p><p>Our induction is complete, so for all positive integers $n$, $x_n=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$. Identical equalities hold for $y_n$ and $z_n$.</p><p>The problem asks for the smallest $n$ such that either $x_n$, $y_n$, or $z_n$ is greater than $90^\\circ$. WLOG, let $x_0=60^\\circ$, $y_0=59.999^\\circ$, and $z_0=60.001^\\circ$. Thus, $x_n=60^\\circ$ for all $n$, $y_n=-(-2)^n(0.001)+60$, and $z_n=(-2)^n(0.001)+60$. Solving for the smallest possible value of $n$ in each sequence, we find that $n=15$ gives $y_n>90^\\circ$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 15}$.</p>",
        "<p>We start from Solution 1 until we reach the recurrence relation $x_n = 180 - 2x_{n - 1}.$ Iterate this again, to get $x_{n - 1} = 180 - 2x_{n - 2}.$ Subtract the two, getting $x_{n} = -x_{n - 1} + 2x_{n - 2}.$ This recurrence has characteristic equation $x^2 + x - 2 = 0 = (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0 \\iff x = -2, 1.$ Now, write \\[x_n = p + q \\cdot (-2)^n.\\] We obtain similar recursions for $y, z$ that can be easily solved by getting $x_1, y_1, z_1$ from the original recursive formula and then using those two values to solve for $p$ and $q.$ Then proceed with the last paragraph of Solution 1.</p>",
        "<p>We note that the problem seems quite complicated, but since it is an AMC 12, the difference between the largest angle of $\\triangle A_nB_nC_n$ and $60^{\\circ}$ (we call this quantity S) most likely reduces to a simpler problem like some repeating sequence. The only obvious sequence (for the answer choices) is a geometric sequence with an integer common ratio. From here, we get that $S_n=0.001S^n$ and we need $S_n>30$. The first power of two greater than $30,000$ is $2^{15}$ thus our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 15}$.</p><p>~Dhillonr25</p>"
