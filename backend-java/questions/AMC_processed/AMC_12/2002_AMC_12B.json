        "<p>Similar to Solution 1, we proceed to get the area of the circle satisfying $f(x)+f(y) \\le 0$, or $16 \\pi$.</p><p>Since $f(x)-f(y) \\le 0 \\implies f(x) \\le f(y)$, we have that by symmetry, if $(x,y)$ is in $R$, then $(y,x)$ is not, and vice versa. Therefore, the shaded part of the circle above the line $y=x$ has the same area as the unshaded part below $y=x$, and the unshaded part above $y=x$ has the same area as the shaded part below $y=x$. This means that exactly half the circle is shaded, allowing us to divide by two to get $\\frac{16 \\pi }{2} = 8\\pi \\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }25}$. ~samrocksnature + ddot1 +Shen kislay kai</p>"
