If $4$ of the faces are colored the same, there are $3$ possible cubes (corresponding to the $3$ possible ways to pick pairs of opposite faces for the other color). If $3$ of the faces are colored the same, the property obviously cannot be satisfied.

        "<p>As with the previous solution, we will simply count the number of valid faces and divide by $2^6$. We say that a cube has a ring of color when four vertical faces are all the same color. If we fix the cube in space, there can be $3$ different rings (in each of the $3$ axis), each of which can take on 2 different colors. This leaves us to choose the remaining two faces (which are opposite one another) in $2^2=4$ ways. However, we have counted coloring that has each face the same color $3$ times for both red and blue. This means that we must subtract the 4 overcounts to get $2*3*2^2-4=20$. Dividing by $2^6$ total colorings, we get $20/2^6=\\frac{5}{16}\\mathbf{(B)}$.~bambithenambi</p>"
