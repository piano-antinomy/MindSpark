Removing the last four digits (the zeros) and subtracting one yields $2600$ for the skipped value.</p><p>In general, each new value of $f(k+2)$ will add two digits to the \"$5$\" and one digit to the \"$1$\". This means that the last number Bernardo writes for $k=6$ is $\\left(500000+1000\\right)^2$, the last for $k = 8$ will be $\\left(50000000+10000\\right)^2$, and so on until $k=2016$. Removing the last $k$ digits as Silvia does will be the same as removing $k/2$ trailing zeroes on the number to be squared. This means that the last number on the board for $k=6$ is $5001^2$, $k=8$ is $50001^2$, and so on. So the first missing number is $5001^2-1,50001^2-1\\text{ etc.}$ The squaring will make a \"$25$\" with two more digits than the last number, a \"$10$\" with one more digit, and a \"$1$\". The missing number is one less than that, so the \"1\" will be subtracted from $f(k)$. In other words, $f(k) = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2}+1\\cdot 10^{k/2}$.</p><p>Therefore:</p><p>\\[f(2) =35 =25 +10\\]\\[f(4) =2600 =2500 +100\\]\\[f(6) =251000 =250000 +1000\\]\\[f(8) = 25010000 = 25000000 + 10000\\]</p><p>And so on. The sum $f(2) + f(4) + f(6) +\\dots + f(2016)$ is:</p><p>$2.52525252525\\dots 2525\\cdot 10^{2015}$ + $1.11111\\dots 110\\cdot 10^{1008}$, with $2016$ repetitions each of \"$25$\" and \"$1$\". There is no carrying in this addition. Therefore each $f(k)$ adds $2 + 5 + 1 = 8$ to the sum of the digits. Since $2n = 2016$, $8n = 4\\cdot 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\text{ 8064}}$.</p>",
