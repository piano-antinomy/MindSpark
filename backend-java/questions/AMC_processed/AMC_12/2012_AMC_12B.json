The same dessert may not be served two days in a row. There must be cake on Friday because of a birthday. How many different dessert menus for the week are possible?</p>",

        "<p>We can count the number of possible foods for each day and then multiply to enumerate the number of combinations.</p><p>On Friday, we have one possibility: cake.</p><p>On Saturday, we have three possibilities: pie, ice cream, or pudding. This is the end of the week.</p><p>On Thursday, we have three possibilities: pie, ice cream, or pudding. We can't have cake because we have to have cake the following day, which is the Friday with the birthday party.</p><p>On Wednesday, we have three possibilities: cake, plus the two things that were not eaten on Thursday.</p><p>Similarly, on Tuesday, we have three possibilities: the three things that were not eaten on Wednesday.</p><p>Likewise on Monday: three possibilities, the three things that were not eaten on Tuesday.</p><p>On Sunday, it is tempting to think there are four possibilities, but remember that cake must be served on Friday. This serves to limit the number of foods we can eat on Sunday, with the result being that there are three possibilities: The three things that were not eaten on Monday.</p><p>So the number of menus is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 729.$The answer is $\\boxed{A}$.</p>",
        "<p>We can perform casework as an understandable means of getting the answer. We can organize our counting based on the food that was served on Wednesday, because whether cake is or is not served on Wednesday seems to significantly affect the number of ways the chef can make said foods for that week.</p><p>Case 1: Cake is served on Wednesday. Here, we have three choices for food on Thursday and Saturday since cake must be served on Friday, and none of these choices are cake, which was served Wednesday. Likewise, we have three choices (pie, ice cream, and pudding) for the food served on Tuesday and thus three choices for those served on Monday and Sunday, with these three choices being whatever was not served on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Hence, for this case, there are $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 243$ possibilities.</p><p>Case 2: Cake is not served on Wednesday. Obviously, this means that pie, ice cream, and pudding are our only choices for Wednesday's food. Since cake must be served on Friday, only ice cream, pudding, and cake can be served on Thursday. However, since one of those foods was chosen for Wednesday, we only have two possibilities for Thursday's food. Like our first case, we have three possibilities for the food served on Tuesday, Monday, and Sunday: whatever was not served on Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday, respectively. $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 486$ possibilities thus exist for this case.</p><p>Adding the number of possibilities together yields that $243 + 486 = 729$ is the total number of menus, making our answer $\\boxed{A}$.</p>",
        "<p>Note that the choice of a food item on a given day is symmetric, i.e. the number of ways to create the meal plan with a cake on Friday is the same as the number of ways to create the meal plan with pudding on Friday, and the same reasoning holds for the other desserts. Since every meal plan is counted by the summation of the $4$ aforementioned plans (note that Friday's dessert has to be one of the $4$ given desserts) and that these cases are mutually exclusive (i.e. you cannot make both a cake and pudding on Friday), each case results in a quarter of the total meal plans (Since there are $4$ desserts, we multiply by $\\tfrac{1}{4}$). The total number of plans with no restrictions can be counted with constructive counting, as follows:</p><p>We note that there are $4$ ways to choose the first dessert. Then, each dessert thereafter must be distinct from the prior one. Since there are $4$ options, and $1$ of them has been taken by the prior, each following dessert can be chosen in $(4 - 1) = 3$ ways. Thus, since there are $6$ desserts other than the first, the total number (without restrictions) is $4 \\cdot 3^6$</p><p>Thus, by our symmetry argument derived prior, we know that the number of desired meal plans is $\\frac{\\text{\\# plans w/o restrictions}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3^6}{4} = 3^6 = 729$, choice $\\boxed{A}$</p><p>~ftwmaster65</p>",
        "<p>Notice that if we consider Friday cake day, Saturday has $3$ choices. Thus, we consider everything from Sunday to Thursday. Suppose Sunday has $4$ choices, and all the rest of the days have $3$ choices. If we multiply $4 \\times 3^5$, we obtain $972$. However, if Wednesday had not been a cake day, there would only be $2$ choices for Thursday. Hence, we know that the answer must be less than $972$.

If there is one consecutive $1$, there are $\\binom{20}{1}$ ways to order them. If there are two consecutive $1$'s, then there are $\\binom{19}{1}$ ways to order them (We treat the two $1$'s like a block, and then order that block with 18 other $0$'s).

From symmetry, there are also $211$ ways to order the $0$'s. Now, from PIE, we subtract out the cases where both the $1$'s and the $0$'s are consecutive. We do this because when counting the ways to order the $1$'s, we counted all of these cases once. Then, we did so again when ordering the $0$'s. So, to only have all of these cases once, we must subtract them. If $1$ is the leftmost digit, then there are $20$ cases where all the $1$'s and $0$'s are consecutive (we basically are choosing how many $1$'s are consecutive, and there are $20$ possibilities. All other digits become $0$, which are automatically consecutive since the $1$'s are consecutive. There are also $20$ cases when $0$ is the left-most digit.

Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ go through $SP$ and $RQ$, respectively, and $SP$ and $RQ$ are opposite sides of the square, we can say that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel with slope $m$. Similarly, $L_3$ and $L_4$ have slope $-\\frac{1}{m}$. Also, note that since square $PQRS$ lies in the first quadrant, $L_1$ and $L_2$ must have a positive slope. Using the point-slope form, we can now find the equations of all four lines: $L_1: y = m(x-3)$, $L_2: y = m(x-5)$, $L_3: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-7)$, $L_4: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-13)$.</p><p><br/>Since $PQRS$ is a square, it follows that $\\Delta x$ between points $P$ and $Q$ is equal to $\\Delta y$ between points $Q$ and $R$. Our approach will be to find $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ in terms of $m$ and equate the two to solve for $m$. $L_1$ and $L_3$ intersect at point $P$. Setting the equations for $L_1$ and $L_3$ equal to each other and solving for $x$, we find that they intersect at $x = \\frac{3m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}$. $L_2$ and $L_3$ intersect at point $Q$. Intersecting the two equations, the $x$-coordinate of point $Q$ is found to be $x = \\frac{5m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}$. Subtracting the two, we get $\\Delta x = \\frac{2m^2}{m^2 + 1}$. Substituting the $x$-coordinate for point $Q$ found above into the equation for $L_2$, we find that the $y$-coordinate of point $Q$ is $y = \\frac{2m}{m^2+1}$. $L_2$ and $L_4$ intersect at point $R$. Intersecting the two equations, the $y$-coordinate of point $R$ is found to be $y = \\frac{8m}{m^2 + 1}$. Subtracting the two, we get $\\Delta y = \\frac{6m}{m^2 + 1}$.

The equation of the line going through $(4,0)$ is given by $y = 3(x-4)$ and the equation of the line going through $(10,0)$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x-10)$.

        "<p>Since $z_0$ is a root of $P$, and $P$ has integer coefficients, $z_0$ must be algebraic. Since $z_0$ is algebraic and lies on the unit circle, $z_0$ must be a root of unity (Comment: this is not true. See this link: <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4323/are-all-algebraic-integers-with-absolute-value-1-roots-of-unity\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>). Since $P$ has degree 4, it seems reasonable (and we will assume this only temporarily) that $z_0$ must be a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th root of unity. These are among the set $\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,(-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3})/2\\}$. Since complex roots of polynomials come in conjugate pairs, we have that $P$ has one (or more) of the following factors: $z+1$, $z-1$, $z^2+1$, or $z^2+z+1$. If $z=1$ then $a+b+c+d+4=0$; a contradiction since $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative. On the other hand, suppose $z=-1$. Then $(a+c)-(b+d)=4$. This implies $a+b=8,7,6,5,4$ while $b+d=4,3,2,1,0$ correspondingly. After listing cases, the only such valid $a,b,c,d$ are $4,4,4,0$, $4,3,3,0$, $4,2,2,0$, $4,1,1,0$, and $4,0,0,0$. </p><p>Now suppose $z=i$. Then $4=(a-c)i+(b-d)$ whereupon $a=c$ and $b-d=4$. But then $a=b=c$ and $d=a-4$. This gives only the cases $a,b,c,d$ equals $4,4,4,0$, which we have already counted in a previous case.</p><p>Suppose $z=-i$. Then $4=i(c-a)+(b-d)$ so that $a=c$ and $b=4+d$. This only gives rise to $a,b,c,d$ equal $4,4,4,0$ which we have previously counted. </p><p>Finally suppose $z^2+z+1$ divides $P$. Using polynomial division ((or that $z^3=1$ to make the same deductions) we ultimately obtain that $b=4+c$. This can only happen if $a,b,c,d$ is $4,4,0,0$. </p><p>Hence we've the polynomials\\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+3x^2+3x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+2x^2+2x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+x^2+x\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3\\]\\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2\\]However, by inspection $4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x+4$ has roots on the unit circle, because $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ which brings the sum to 92 (choice B). Note that this polynomial has a 5th root of unity as a root. We will show that we were \\textit{almost} correct in our initial assumption; that is that $z_0$ is at most a 5th root of unity, and that the last polynomial we obtained is the last polynomial with the given properties. Suppose that $z_0$ in an $n$th root of unity where $n>5$, and $z_0$ is not a 3rd or 4th root of unity. (Note that 1st and 2nd roots of unity are themselves 4th roots of unity). If $n$ is prime, then \\textit{every} $n$th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial, but since $n>5$ and the degree of our polynomial is 4, this is impossible. Suppose $n$ is composite. If it has a prime factor $p$ greater than 5 then again every $p$th root of unity must satisfy our polynomial and we arrive at the same contradiction. Therefore suppose $n$ is divisible only by 2,3,or 5. Since by hypothesis $z_0$ is not a 2nd or 3rd root of unity, $z_0$ must be a 5th root of unity. Since 5 is prime, every 5th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial. That is, the other 4 complex 5th roots of unity must satisfy $P(z_0)=0$. But $(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ has exactly all 5th roots of unity excluding 1, and $(x^5-1)/(x-1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$. Thus this must divide $P$ which implies $P(x)=4(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$. This completes the proof.</p>",
        "<p>First, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $z_0=1$ or $-1$. $1$ does not work because $P(1)\\geq 4$. Assume that $z_0=-1$.

Now $4+b=4+c$ gives $b=c$, therefore the only possible choices for $(a,b,c,d)$ are $(4,t,t,0)$. In these cases, $P(-1)=4-4+t-t+0=0$. The sum of $P(1)$ over these cases is $\\sum_{t=0}^{4} (4+4+t+t) = 40+20=60$.</p><p>Second, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\mathbb{R}$, so $z_0=x_0+iy_0$ for some real $x_0, y_0$, $|x_0|<1$. By conjugate roots theorem we have that $P(z_0)=P(z_0^{*})=0$, therefore $(z-z_0)(z-z_0^{*}) = (z^2 - 2x_0*z + 1)$ is a factor of $P(z)$, and we may assume that </p><p>\\[P(z) = (z^2-2x_0 z + 1)(4z^2 + pz + d)\\]</p><p>for some real $p$.

However, $da \\leq 4c$, therefore $da-4c=0$. This is true only when $d=c$. Also, we get $k=0$ again. In this case, $b=d+4$, so $a=b=4$, $c=d=0$, $x_0=-1/2$. $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/3}$. $P(1)=12$.</p><p>Last case: $d=4$. We have $a=b=c=d=4$ and that $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/5}$. $P(1)=20$.</p><p>Therefore the desired sum is $60+12+20=92 ...\\framebox{B}$.</p>",
        "<p>First, notice that $z=1$ cannot be a root of the polynomial because $a,b,c,d \\geq 0$. Multiplying the polynomial by $(z-1)$ yields $P(z)(z-1) = 4z^5-(4-a)z^4-(a-b)z^3-(b-c)z^2-(c-d)z-d$, so for $z \\neq 1$ to be a root of $P(z)$, $4z^5 = (4-a)z^4+(a-b)z^3+(b-c)z^2+(c-d)z+d$. Now we consider the root $z_0$ with $|z_0|=1$. $|4z_0^5| = 4$, so the right hand side must have absolute value 4. By the triangle inequality, $|(4-a)z_0^4+(a-b)z_0^3+(b-c)z_0^2+(c-d)z_0+d|$ $\\leq |(4-a)z_0^4|+|(a-b)z_0^3| + |(b-c)z_0^2| + |(c-d)z_0|+d$ $= (4-a)+(a-b)+(b-c)+(c-d)+d=4$, with equality if and only if each of $4z_0^5$, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, $(c-d)z_0$, and $d$ is either zero or in the same direction as all the others when looked at as vectors in the complex plane. </p><p>We can now divide into two cases: $d \\neq 0$ and $d=0$. If $d \\neq 0$, then $4z_0^5$ must be real by the previous argument, so $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity. Also, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, and $(c-d)z_0$ must all be zero because if $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity, none of these can be real numbers with positive absolute value. Therefore, $a=4$, $b=a$, $c=b$, and $d=c$, leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4)$. Just to be sure, we can easily verify that this solution leads to the six complex numbers under question being in the same direction.</p><p>If $d=0$, then each of $4z_0^5$, $(4-a)z_0^4$, $(a-b)z_0^3$, $(b-c)z_0^2$, and $cz_0$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others, so each of $4z_0^4$, $(4-a)z_0^3$, $(a-b)z_0^2$, $(b-c)z_0$, and $c$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others. We can divide this into two cases: $c \\neq 0$ and $c=0$. If $c \\neq 0$, then $4z_0^4$ must be real. Then, $z_0$ is a fourth root of unity. If $z_0$ is not a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$, $(a-b)z_0^2$, and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero, implying that $a=4$, $b=a=4$, and $c=b=4$, leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,0)$. If $z_0$ is also a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$ and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero but $(a-b)z_0^2$ can be anything. This implies $a=4$ and $b=c$ with no other restrictions, leading to the new solutions $(a,b,c,d) = (4,3,3,0), (4,2,2,0), (4,1,1,0), (4,0,0,0)$. </p><p>If $c=0$, then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^3$, $(4-a)z_0^2$, $(a-b)z_0$, and $b$ must be zero or in the same direction as all the others. If $b \\neq 0$, then $z_0$ must be a third root of unity, so $(4-a)z_0^2$ and $(a-b)z_0$ must be zero, implying $a=b=4$, leading to the new solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,0,0)$. </p><p>If $b=0$, then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^2$, $(4-a)z_0$, and $a$ must be zero or in the same direction as the others. For $|z_0|=1$, $a = 4$, but we have already counted the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,0,0,0)$. </p><p>Then, the complete list of solutions is $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4),(4,4,4,0),(4,3,3,0),(4,2,2,0),(4,1,1,0),(4,0,0,0),(4,4,0,0)$, leading to a sum of $\\framebox{B}=92$.</p>"

For any right triangle $ABC$ with the right labeling described in the problem, any reflection $A'B'C'$ labeled that way will give us $\\tan CBA \\cdot \\tan C'B'A' = 1$. First we consider the reflection about the line $y=2.5$. Only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex at $(0,5)$ do not reflect to a traingle $\\subseteq T$. Within those triangles, consider a reflection about the line $y=5-x$. Then only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex on the line $y=0$ do not reflect to a triangle $\\subseteq T$. So we only need to look at right triangles that have vertices $(0,5), (*,0), (*,*)$. There are three cases:</p><p>Case 1: $A=(0,5)$. Then $B=(*,0)$ is impossible.</p><p>Case 2: $B=(0,5)$. Then we look for $A=(x,y)$ such that $\\angle BAC=90^{\\circ}$ and that $C=(*,0)$. They are: $(A=(x,5), C=(x,0))$, $(A=(3,2), C=(1,0))$ and $(A=(4,1), C=(3,0))$. The product of their values of $\\tan \\angle CBA$ is $\\frac{5}{1}\\cdot  \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{625}{144}$.</p><p>Case 3: $C=(0,5)$. Then $A=(*,0)$ is impossible.</p><p>Therefore $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}  \\ \\frac{625}{144}}$ is the answer.</p>",
        "<p>This is just another way for the reasoning of solution 1. Picture the question to be a grid of unit squares instead of a coordinate system. Note that the restriction, (This is just to make visualization easier.) Define a \"cell\" to be a rectangle in the set of $S.$ For example, a cell can be (labeled in a red):</p><p>[asy] unitsize(0.5 cm); draw((0,1)--(0,5),black); draw((1,0)--(1,5),black); draw((2,0)--(2,5),black); draw((3,0)--(3,5),black); draw((4,0)--(4,5),black); draw((0,1)--(5,1),black); draw((5,0)--(5,5),black); draw((1,0)--(5,0),black); draw((0,2)--(5,2),black); draw((0,3)--(5,3),black); draw((0,4)--(5,4),black); draw((0,5)--(5,5),black); draw((0,1)--(5,1),red); draw((0,1)--(0,5),red); draw((0,5)--(5,5),red); draw((5,5)--(5,1),red); [/asy]</p><p>Note that choosing any three points and labeling them according to the problem will result in a product of one.
