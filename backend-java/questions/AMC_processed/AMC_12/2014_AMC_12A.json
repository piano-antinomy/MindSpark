By substituting $b$ and $c$ in the arithmetic progression expression with the obtained values from the geometric progression, we obtain the equation, $a=2ar^2-ar$ which can be simplified to $(r-1)(2r+1)=0$ giving us $r=1$ or $r=-1/2$. Thus, from the geometric progression, $a=a$, $b=1/4a$ and $c=-1/2a$.

Since a geometric ratio has a common ratio between terms, we have $(a+2d)/a = (a+d)/a+2d$. Cross multiplying, we obtain the equation $(a+2d)^2=a(a+d)$.

        "<p>The parabola is symmetric through $y=- \\frac{4}{3}x$, and the common distance is $5$, so the directrix is the line through $(1,7)$ and $(-7,1)$, which is the line \\[3x-4y = -25.\\] Using the point-line distance formula, the parabola is the locus \\[x^2+y^2 = \\frac{\\left\\lvert 3x-4y+25 \\right\\rvert^2}{3^2+4^2}\\] which rearranges to $(4x+3y)^2 = 25(6x-8y+25)$.</p><p>Let $m = 4x+3y \\in \\mathbb Z$, $\\left\\lvert m \\right\\rvert \\le 1000$. Put $m = 25k$ to obtain\\[25k^2 = 6x-8y+25\\]\\[25k = 4x+3y.\\]and accordingly we find by solving the system that $x = \\frac{1}{2} (3k^2-3) + 4k$ and $y = -2k^2+3k+2$.</p><p>One can show that the values of $k$ that make $(x,y)$ an integer pair are precisely odd integers $k$.* For $\\left\\lvert 25k \\right\\rvert \\le 1000$ this is $k= -39,-37,-35,\\dots,39$, so $40$ values work and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.</p><p>(Solution by C-273)</p><ul><li>You can do this by noting 2 has to divide $(3k^2-3)$, so $3k^2$ is congruent to 3 modulo 2. Dividing by 3 (since 2 and 3 are coprime), $k^2$ is odd, so $k$ must be odd. - (Orion 2010)</li></ul>",
        "<p>The axis of $P$ is inclined at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the coordinate axis, where $\\tan\\theta = \\tfrac 34$. We rotate the coordinate axis by angle $\\theta$ anti-clockwise, so that the parabola now has a vertical symmetry axis relative to the rotated coordinates. Let $(\\widetilde{x}, \\widetilde{y})$ be the coordinates in the rotated system. Then $(x,y)$ and $(\\widetilde{x}, \\widetilde{y})$ are related by \\begin{align}   \\nonumber x = \\widetilde{x}\\cos\\theta -\\widetilde{y}\\sin\\theta &= \\tfrac 45 \\widetilde{x} - \\tfrac 35 \\widetilde{y}, \\\\    y = \\widetilde{x}\\sin\\theta +\\widetilde{y}\\cos\\theta &= \\tfrac 35 \\widetilde{x} + \\tfrac 45 \\widetilde{y} \\end{align}In the rotated coordinate system, the parabola has focus at $(0,0)$ and the two points on it are at $(5,0)$ and $(-5,0)$. Therefore, the directrix is $\\widetilde{y}=\\pm 5$; we can, WLOG, choose $\\widetilde{y}=-5$. For a point on the parabola, it is equidistant from the focus and directrix, so the equation of the parabola is \\begin{align}\\tag{2}   \\widetilde{x}^2+\\widetilde{y}^2 = (\\widetilde{y}+5)^2 \\qquad  &\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \\widetilde{y} = \\tfrac{1}{10}(\\widetilde{x}^2-25) \\end{align}From $(1)$ we have $|4x+3y|=5\\widetilde{x}$, so we need $|\\widetilde{x}|<200$. Substituting $(2)$ in $(1)$, we get\\begin{align*}   50x &= 40 \\widetilde{x} - 3 \\widetilde{x}^2 + 75, \\\\   50y &= 30 \\widetilde{x} + 4 \\widetilde{x}^2 - 100 \\end{align*}For $x$ to be an integer $\\widetilde{x}$ must be a multiple of 5; setting $\\widetilde{x}=5a$ we get \\[2x = 8a - 3 a^2 + 3\\]Now we need $a$ to be odd, i.e. $\\widetilde{x}=5a$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case we get $y = 3 a + 2 a^2 - 2$, which is also an integer. The values that satisfy the given conditions correspond to $\\widetilde{x}= \\{\\pm 5\\cdot (2k-1)\\mid k = 0, 1, \\ldots , 19 \\}={-195, -185, -175, ..., 195}$, and there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\ 40}$ such numbers.</p><p>(Solution by Shaddoll)</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2014amc12a/384\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2014amc12a/384</a></p>"
