        "<p>This solution has a similar idea to that of above.We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$:If $a_7 = -1$, we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$'s for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$. This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$, we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$. However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$, $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$.If $a_{7}=0$, we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$, we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$. Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$. Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$, and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$. Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.If $a_{7}=1$, we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$, we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$. So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$, we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$. So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$. In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$, $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$. We can now start building up our values for $S$: $S_{0} = 2$ ($a_{0} = 0, 1$), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$. So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \\boxed{3281}$, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.~advanture</p>",
