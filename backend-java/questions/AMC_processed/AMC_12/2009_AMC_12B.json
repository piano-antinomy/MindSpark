And as $41 + 761 = 802$ is already the largest option, the answer must be $\\boxed{802}$.</p><p>We will now show a complete solution, with a proof that no other values are prime. </p><p>Consider the function $g(x) = x^2 - 360x + 400$, then obviously $f(x) = g(x^2)$.</p><p>The roots of $g$ are:\\[x_{1,2}  = \\frac{ 360 \\pm \\sqrt{ 360^2 - 4\\cdot 400 } }2  = 180 \\pm 80 \\sqrt 5\\]</p><p>We can then write $g(x) = (x - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$, and thus $f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x^2 - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$.</p><p>We would now like to factor the right hand side further, using the formula $(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)$. To do this, we need to express both constants as squares of some other constants. Luckily, we have a pretty good idea how they look like.</p><p>We are looking for rational $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt 5)^2 = 180 + 80\\sqrt 5$.

We can easily guess (or compute) the solution $a=10$, $b=4$.</p><p>Hence $180 + 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 + 4\\sqrt 5)^2$, and we can easily verify that also $180 - 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 - 4\\sqrt 5)^2$.</p><p>We now know the complete factorization of $f(x)$: </p><p>\\[f(x) = (x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)\\]</p><p>As the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots. </p><p>We have $(x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4\\sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20$,and $(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20$.</p><p>Hence we obtain the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)$.</p><p>For $x\\geq 20$ both terms are positive and larger than one, hence $f(x)$ is not prime.

In both cases, $f(x)$ is indeed a prime, and their sum is $f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = \\boxed{802}$.</p><p>Instead of doing the hard work, we can try to guess the factorization. One good approach:</p><p>We can make the observation that $f(x)$ looks similar to $(x^2 + 20)^2$ with the exception of the $x^2$ term. In fact, we have $(x^2 + 20)^2 = x^4 + 40x^2 + 400$.

This is because given a \"mapped\" square, there are $4$ choices for the vertex that will remain in the first quadrant; but once that point is chosen, there is only $1$ distribution of the other $3$ vertices that will result in a square. So, we want four times the number of squares we can make in the first quadrant grid.</p><p><br/>We divide our counting method into two cases: squares with side length $0$ after mapping (which means all four vertices are in the same position relative to their own grids) and squares with side length $1-4$ after mapping.</p><p><br/>Case 1: There are $25$ such squares of length $0$ (this is equivalent to counting the number of points on the grid). However, in this scenario, all of the vertices have been mapped onto the same point. So instead of $4$ choices for the first quadrant vertex, there is only one. Subsequently there are only $25$ such squares that correspond to them.</p><p><br/>Case 2: Let a square with sides parallel to the axes be known as $A$ squares. These $A$ squares can have side length $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$. However, the number of $A$ squares possible depends on the side length. For example, there is only $1$ possible $A$ square of side length $4$, but $16$ squares of side length $1$. To be exact, there are $(5-s)^2$ possible $A$ squares of side length $s$. So, the total number of $A$ squares is</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>But what about \"tilted\" squares? Notice that \"tilted squares\" can always be inscribed (drawn within) another, bigger square. Let a square inscribed within an $A$ square be called a $B$ square. How many $B$ squares are there? Well, this also depends on the side length. We only want squares whose vertices are lattice points (integer value coordinates), so the number of $B$ squares should increase along with side length. We defined $B$ squares to be inscribed within $A$ squares, so we can say that all $B$ squares have their vertices on the side on an $A$ square. Consider an $A$ square with side length $4$. There are $3$ other lattice points along the side of the $A$ square, not counting the vertices. Therefore, we can say that there are $s-1$ possible $B$ squares for every $A$ square with side length $s$. We can multiply $(s-1)$ times the number of $A$ squares to get the number of $B$ squares. This is </p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>total $B$ squares. But we need to add these two quantities to get the number of squares for Case 2:</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2 + \\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>By distributive property, the expression becomes</p><p><br/>$\\sum_{s=1}^4 s(5-s)^2$</p><p><br/>Solving, we get $50$ \"mapped\" squares, both $A$ and $B$. Multiplying this by $4$ to get the corresponding number of \"unmapped\" squares, then adding to get the number of squares for Case 1, we get</p><p><br/>$50*4 + 25 = 225 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{E}}$.</p>"
