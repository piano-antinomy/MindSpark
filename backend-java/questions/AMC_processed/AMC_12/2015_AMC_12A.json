        "<p>We can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{123456789}{2^{22} \\cdot 10^4} = \\frac{12345.6789}{2^{22}}$.

Indeed, this happens twenty-two times since we divide by $2$ twenty-two times, so we will need $22$ more digits. Hence, the answer is $4 + 22 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 26}$</p>",

The dividend is a huge number, but we know it doesn't have any digits to the right of the decimal point. Also, the dividend is not a multiple of 10 (it's not a multiple of 2), so these 26 divisions by 10 will each shift the entire dividend one digit to the right of the decimal point.

From there, we notice that there are 11 places after the decimal point in the quotient, which means there will be another 11 after we divide this quotient by 2048 again.

The points where the ellipse intersects the coordinate axes are $(0, 1), (0, -1), (4, 0)$, and $(-4, 0)$. Recall that the two foci lie on the major axis of the ellipse and are a distance of $c$ away from the center of the ellipse, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, with $a$ being half the length of the major (longer) axis and $b$ being half the minor (shorter) axis of the ellipse.

The value for $b$ is achieved when the circle passes through the foci and only three points on the ellipse, which is possible when the circle touches $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$. Which point we use does not change what value of $b$ is attained, so we use $(0, -1)$. Here, we must find the point $(0, y)$ such that the distance from $(0, y)$ to both foci and $(0, -1)$ is the same. Now, we have the two following equations. \\[(\\sqrt{15})^2 + (y)^2 = b^2\\] \\[y + 1 = b \\implies y = b - 1\\] Substituting for $y$, we have that \\[15 + (b - 1)^2 = b^2 \\implies -2b + 16 = 0.\\]</p><p>Solving the above simply yields that $b = 8$, so our answer is $a + b = \\sqrt{15} + 8 \\textbf{ (D)}$.</p>",

For the circle to hit the ellipse four times, $\\sqrt{n^2+15}>n+1$ ($n+1$ being the distance between the circle's center and the farthest end of the ellipse that lies on the y-axis). Both sides are evidently positive, so we can square both sides, leaving $n^2+15>n^2+2n+1 \\implies n<7$. The function for the radius $\\sqrt{n^2+15}$ is always increasing as $n$ increases right of $n=0$ and as $n$ decreases left of $n=0$.

The square I use will have vertices of $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$. </p><p>A way we can figure out when the distance is at least $0.5$ is if we figure out when it isn't $0.5$. Let's pick a point on our segment and denote it with $(x, 0)$. Then, there are three ways a second point can be within the boundaries of this first point. Either, it is to the left of it (if possible), to the right of it, or it is on the segment that forms a right angle with it. </p><p>Obviously, there is $x$ distance if the point is to the left of the point $x$.

We can do this simply by doing $4- \\frac{6-\\pi}{8}$ (as $4$ is the total amount of length).

        "<p>Let us start with the two circles in $L_0$ and the circle in $L_1$. Let the larger circle in $L_0$ be named circle $X$ with radius $x$ and the smaller be named circle $Y$ with radius $y$. Also let the single circle in $L_1$ be named circle $Z$ with radius $z$. Draw radii $x$, $y$, and $z$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Drop altitudes $a$ and $b$ from the center of $Z$ to these radii $x$ and $y$, respectively, and drop altitude $c$ from the center of $Y$ to radius $x$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Connect the centers of circles $x$, $y$, and $z$ with their radii, and utilize the Pythagorean Theorem. We attain the following equations. \\[(x - z)^2 + a^2 = (x + z)^2 \\implies a^2 = 4xz\\] \\[(y - z)^2 + b^2 = (y + z)^2 \\implies b^2 = 4yz\\] \\[(x - y)^2 + c^2 = (x + y)^2 \\implies c^2 = 4xy\\]</p><p>We see that $a = 2\\sqrt{xz}$, $b = 2\\sqrt{yz}$, and $c = 2\\sqrt{xy}$. Since $a + b = c$, we have that $2\\sqrt{xz} + 2\\sqrt{yz} = 2\\sqrt{xy}$. Divide this equation by $2\\sqrt{xyz}$, and this equation becomes the well-known relation of Descartes's Circle Theorem $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}}.$ We can apply this relationship recursively with the circles in layers $L_2, L_3, \\cdots, L_6$.</p><p>Here, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of all circles in layer $n$. The notation in the problem asks us to find the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the radii in each circle in this collection, which is $\\textstyle\\sum_{n=0}^{6}S(n)$. We already have that $S(0) = S(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}} = \\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}$. Then, $S(2) = 2S(1) + S(0) = 3S(0)$. Additionally, $S(3) = 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 9S(0)$, and $S(4) = 2S(3) + 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 27S(0)$. Now, we notice that $S(n + 1) = 3S(n)$ because $S(n + 1) = 2S(n) + 2S(n - 1) + \\cdots + 2S(1) + S(0)$, which is a power of $3.$ Hence, our desired sum is $(1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243)(S(0)) = 365\\left(\\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}\\right)$. This simplifies to $365\\left(\\frac{143}{73(70)}\\right) = \\frac{143}{14} \\textbf{(D)}$.</p><p>Note that the circles in this question are known as Ford circles.</p>",
        "<p>Let the two circles from $L_0$ be of radius $r_1$ and $r_2$, with $r_1>r_2$. Let the circle of radius $r_1$ be circle $A$ and the circle of radius $r_2$ be circle $B$. Now, let the circle of $L_1$ have radius $r_3$. Let this circle be circle $C$. Draw the radii of the three circles down to the common tangential line and connect the radii. Draw two lines parallel to the common tangential line of the two layers intersecting the center point of circle $B$ and the center point of circle $C$. Now, we have $3$ right triangles with a line of common length (The two parallel lines). Using the pythagorean theorem, we get the formula $\\sqrt{(r_2+r_1)^2-(r_2-r_1)^2}=\\sqrt{(r_1+r_3)^2-(r_1-r_3)^2}+\\sqrt{(r_2+r_3)^2-(r_2-r_3)^2}$ Now we solve for $r_3$. Square both sides, use the identity $(a^2-b^2)=(a+b)(a-b)$ and simplify: $(2r_2)(2r_1) = (2r_1)(2r_3)+2\\sqrt{16r_1r_3r_2r_3}+(2r_2)(2r_3)=4(r_1r_3+r_2r_3+2r_3\\sqrt{r_1r_2})=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\\\ 4r_2r_1=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\implies r_3=\\frac{r_2r_1}{r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}}$</p><p><br/>Now, let's change this into a function to clean things up: $f(x,y) = \\frac{xy}{x+y+2\\sqrt{xy}}=\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}$Let's begin to rewrite the sum we want to find in terms of the radii of the circles, call this $g(x)$: $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{xy}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{y}+\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ Using this, we can find the sum of some layers: $L_0$, $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}$, $L_0$ and $L_1$: $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}+\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} = 2\\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg)$ This is interesting, we have that the sum of Layer 0 and Layer 1 is equal to twice of Layer 0. If we continue and find the sum of layers 0, 1 and 2, we see it is equal to $5(L_0)$. This is getting very interesting, there must be some pattern. First of all, we should observe that finding $g(x)$ of a circle is equivalent to adding up those of the 2 larger circles to construct the smaller one. Second, upon further observation, we can draw out the layers. When we're finding the next layer, we can split the current layers across the center, so that each half includes the center circle $L_1$. Now, if we were to find $g(x)$, we notice we are doubling the current sum and including the center circle twice. So, the recursive sum would be $a_n=3a_{n-1}-1$. So, applying this new formula, we get $\\sum_{C \\in S}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} = (3(3(3(3(3(3-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)\\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg )=365\\cdot \\bigg (\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} \\bigg)=365\\cdot\\frac{143}{70\\cdot73}=\\boxed{\\frac{143}{14}}$</p>",
