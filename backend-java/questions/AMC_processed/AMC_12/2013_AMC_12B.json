Since $CN$ bisects $\\angle BCA$, applying the angle bisector theorem and we can get $BC=\\frac{a}{m}$;$AN=2m$. Now applying LOC, we can get $(a+2m)^2+(a+m)^2-2(a+2m)(a+m)\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}=1$. We get $a^2+3m^2+3am=1$. Now applying the Stewart theorem in $\\triangle BAC$, we can find that ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}+(a+2m)^2=2(1+(a+m)^2)}$, after simplifying, we get ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}-a^2+2m^2=2}$. After observation, the main key for this problem is $a^2$, so we can solve $a$ in term of $m$. Let's see the equation ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}-a^2+2m^2=2}$, we can find that $a=\\sqrt{2}m$ so $a^2=2m^2$. Now back solving the first equation we can get that $a=\\frac{-3m+\\sqrt{4-3m^2}}{m}$cuz the negative one can't work. After solving, we can get that $m^2=\\frac{1}{5+3\\sqrt{2}}$ so $a^2=2m^2$ and we get $a^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}$~ bluesoul</p>",

        "<p>If we factor into irreducible polynomials (in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$), each factor $f_i$ has exponent $1$ in the factorization and degree at most $2$ (since the $a+bi$ with $b\\ne0$ come in conjugate pairs with product $a^2+b^2$). Clearly we want the product of constant terms of these polynomials to equal $50$; for $d\\mid 50$, let $f(d)$ be the number of permitted $f_i$ with constant term $d$. It's easy to compute $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=3$, $f(5)=5$, $f(10)=5$, $f(25)=6$, $f(50)=7$, and obviously $f(d) = 1$ for negative $d\\mid 50$.</p><p>Note that by the distinctness condition, the only constant terms $d$ that can be repeated are those with $d^2\\mid 50$ and $f(d)>1$, i.e. $+1$ and $+5$. Also, the $+1$s don't affect the product, so we can simply count the number of polynomials with no constant terms of $+1$ and multiply by $2^{f(1)} = 4$ at the end.</p><p>We do casework on the (unique) even constant term $d\\in\\{\\pm2,\\pm10,\\pm50\\}$ in our product. For convenience, let $F(d)$ be the number of ways to get a product of $50/d$ without using $\\pm 1$ (so only using $\\pm5,\\pm25$) and recall $f(-1) = 1$; then our final answer will be $2^{f(1)}\\sum_{d\\in\\{2,10,50\\}}(f(-d)+f(d))(F(-d)+F(d))$.
