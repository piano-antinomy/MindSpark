Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$. Since $d$ is an integer, the difference between the first and last terms, $11d$, must be divisible by $11.$ Since the total difference must be less than $60$, we can start checking multiples of $11$ less than $60$ for the total difference between $a_1$ and $a_{12}$.

        "<p>First, there is only one way for the middle square to be black because it is not affected by the rotation. Then we can consider the corners and edges separately.

There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares.

Thus, there are $8$ cases.<br/>Case 3: 2 white squares. We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this.<br/>Case 4: 3 white squares.Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case.<br/>Case 5: 4 white squares.Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4.Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions.

We can see that $a_1 < a_2$, and that $a_1 < a_3 < a_2$, and that $a_3 < a_4 < a_2$, and that $a_3 < a_5 < a_4$ ... </p><p>From this, we find the pattern that $a_{k-1} < a_{k+1} < a_k$.</p><p>Examining this relationship, we see that every new number $a_k$ will be between the previous two terms, $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$. Therefore, we can see that $a_1$ is the smallest number, $a_2$ is the largest number, and that all odd terms are less than even terms. Furthermore, we can see that for every odd k, $a_k < a_{k+2}$, and for every even k, $a_k > a_{k+2}$</p><p>This means that rearranging the terms in descending order will first have all the even terms from $a_2$ to $a_{2012}$, in that order, and then all odd terms from $a_{2011}$ to $a_1$, in that order (so $\\{b_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011} = {a_2, a_4, a_6, ... a_{2008}, a_{2010}, a_{2011}, a_{2009}, ... a_5, a_3, a_1}$).</p><p>We can clearly see that there will be no solution k where k is even, as the $k$th term in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ will appear in the same position in its sequence as the $2k$th term does in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$, where k is even. Therefore, we only have to look at the odd terms of $a_k$, which occur in the latter part of $b_k$.</p><p>Looking at the back of both sequences, we see that term k in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ progresses backwards in the equation $2012 - k$, and that term k in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ progresses backwards in the equation $2k - 1$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $671$.</p><p>However, remember that we started counting from the back of both sequences. So, plugging $671$ back into either side of the equation from earlier, we get our answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 1341}$.</p><p>Sorry for the sloppy explanation. It's been two years since I've tried to give a solution to a problem, and this is the first time I've really used \\LaTeX. But I think this solution takes a different approach than the one above.</p>"

        "<p>Our goal is to determine how many times the graph of $nf(xf(x))=x$ intersects the graph of $y=x$. (Conversely, we can also divide the equation by $n$ to get $f(xf(x))=\\frac{x}{n}$ and look at the graph $y=\\frac{x}{n}$)</p><p>We begin by analyzing the behavior of $\\{x\\}$. It increases linearly with a slope of one, then when it reaches the next integer, it repeats itself. We can deduce that the function is like a sawtooth wave, with a period of one. We then analyze the function $f(x)=|2\\{x\\}-1|$. The slope of the teeth is multiplied by 2 to get 2, and the function is moved one unit downward. The function can then be described as starting at -1, moving upward with a slope of 2 to get to 1, and then repeating itself, still with a period of 1. The absolute value of the function is then taken. This results in all the negative segments becoming flipped in the Y direction. The positive slope starting at -1 of the function ranging from $u$ to $u.5$, where u is any arbitrary integer, is now a negative slope starting at positive 1.  The function now looks like the letter V repeated within every square in the first row. </p><p>It is now that we address the goal of this, which is to determine how many times the function intersects the line $y=x$. Since there are two line segments per box, the function has two chances to intersect the line $y=x$ for every integer. If the height of the function is higher than $y=x$ for every integer on an interval, then every chance within that interval intersects the line. </p><p>Returning to analyzing the function, we note that it is multiplied by $x$, and then fed into $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is a periodic function, we can model it as multiplying the function's frequency by $x$. This gives us $2x$ chances for every integer, which is then multiplied by 2 once more to get $4x$ chances for every integer. The amplitude of this function is initially 1, and then it is multiplied by $n$, to give an amplitude of $n$. The function intersects the line $y=x$ for every chance in the interval of $0\\leq x \\leq n$, since the function is n units high. The function ceases to intersect $y=x$ when $n < x$, since the height of the function is lower than $y=x$. </p><p>The number of times the function intersects $y=x$ is then therefore equal to $4+8+12...+4n$. We want this sum to be greater than 2012 which occurs when $n=32 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{(C)}$ .</p>"
