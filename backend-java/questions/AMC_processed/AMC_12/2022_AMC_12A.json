Then notice that the hypotenuse must be $(r-x)+(r-y)$, so it must be the case that \\[a_i^2+b_i^2=(2r-a_i-b_i)^2.\\] Similarly, if with a pair $(a_i,b_i)$ the circle is an incircle, the hypotenuse must be $(x-r)+(y-r)$, leading to the same equation. </p><p>Notice that this equation can be simplified through SFFT to \\[(a_i-2r)(b_i-2r)=2r^2.\\] Thus, we want the smallest $r$ such that this equation has at least $14$ distinct pairs $(a_i,b_i)$ for which this holds. The obvious choice to check is $r=6$. In this case, since $2r^2=2^3\\cdot 3^2$ has $12$ positive factors, we get $12$ pairs, and we get another two if the factors are $-8,-9$ or vice versa. One can check that for smaller values of $r$, we do not even get close to $14$ possible pairs.</p><p>When $r=6$, the smallest possible $c$-value is clearly when the factors are negative. When this occurs, $a_i=4, b_i=3$ (or vice versa), so the mimimal $c$ is $5$. The largest possible $c$-value occurs when the largest of $a_i$ and $b_i$ are maximized. This occurs when the factors are $72$ and $1$, leading to $a_i=84, b_i=13$ (or vice-versa), leading to a maximal $c$ of $85$.</p><p>Hence the answer is $\\frac{85}5=\\boxed{17}$.</p><p>~ bluelinfish</p>",
