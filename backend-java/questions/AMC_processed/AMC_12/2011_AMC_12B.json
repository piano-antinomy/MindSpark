        "<p>This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$. Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$. Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$, and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$. If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$. Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$, we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$, is indeed equal to $\\frac{P_1}{2}$. Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \\frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$, $P_n = \\frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$. Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$, we get that $P_n = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$. If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us:First Sequence:$x_1 < 2012$</p><p>$x_2 < 2013$</p><p>$x_3 < 2011$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is:$x_1 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$</p><p>$x_2 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$</p><p>$x_3 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$. Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when:$2^{n-2} < 503$(You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$. If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$, we see that $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$(and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\\boxed{D}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"

The bug can start the \"detour\" from any point on or inside the rectangle. Notice that the bug can go 5 steps in the y direction, 5 steps in the x direction, or anything in between, so the points covered by possible detours from any point would look like a rhombus or square rotated 45 degrees (with centre at a point on or inside the rectangle).

Starting from any point on the border, the farthest that it can go is 5 units in some cardinal direction, which gives us the tiled region in the diagram above.
