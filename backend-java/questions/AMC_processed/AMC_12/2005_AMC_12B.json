So this gives 2 cases.</p><p>The ants from $E/F$ traveling to $A/B$ is equivalent to them traveling to $C/D$ (both remove 2 elements from another set). And the ants from $E/F$ traveling to $A/C$ is equivalent to them traveling to $A/D$ or $B/C$ or $B/D$ (both remove 1 element from the other 2 sets). Also, for each of the 3 pairs of ants there are 2 ways the pair of ants can go to 2 points (for example, $E\\mapsto A$ and $F\\mapsto B$ or $E\\mapsto B$ and $F\\mapsto A$) so there are $2^{3}(2\\cdot1 + 4\\cdot2) = 80$ possibilties. There are a total of $2^{12}$ ways the ants can move so the answer is $\\frac{80}{2^{12}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{5}{256}}$.~LuisFonseca123</p>"
