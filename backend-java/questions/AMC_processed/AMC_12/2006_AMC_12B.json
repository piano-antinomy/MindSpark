Similary we have $x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ when $y = 0$. Then we see what happens at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Clearly at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we see that $y \\le \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. By symmetry we have $x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ when $y = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So we get a graph like [asy] size(5cm); D((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle); D((1,-0.1)--(1,0.1)); D((2,-0.1)--(2,0.1)); D((-0.1,1)--(0.1,1)); D((-0.1,2)--(0.1,2)); D((2,0)--(3,1)--(1,3)--(0,2)); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{6}\", (1,0), plain.S); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{3}\", (2,0), plain.S); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{2}\", (3,0), plain.S); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{6}\", (0,1), plain.W); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{3}\", (0,2), plain.W); MP(\"\\frac{\\pi}{2}\", (0,3), plain.W); [/asy]Thus the area of what we are interested in is \\[\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} - (\\frac{\\pi^2}{18} + \\frac{\\pi^2}{36}) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}.\\]~coolmath_2018</p>"

(Also, $a_{2006}$ cannot be 1 in this case since $d$ does not divide $1$, so we do not care about these $a_2$ at all.)</p><p>From now on, suppose $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$.</p><p><br/>We will now show that $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2006$. We will do this with 3 lemmas.</p><p><br/><b>Lemma:</b> If $a_j \\neq a_{j + 1}$, and neither value is $0$, then $\\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \\max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$.</p><p><b>Proof:</b> There are 2 cases to consider.</p><p>If $a_j > a_{j + 1}$, then $a_{j + 2} = a_j - a_{j + 1}$, and $a_{j + 3} = |a_j - 2a_{j + 1}|$. So $a_j > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_j > a_{j + 3}$.</p><p>If $a_j < a_{j + 1}$, then $a_{j + 2} = a_{j + 1} - a_j$, and $a_{j + 3} = a_j$. So $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 3}$.</p><p>In both cases, $\\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \\max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$, as desired.</p><p><b>Lemma:</b> If $a_i = a_{i + 1}$, then $a_i = 1$. Moreover, if instead we have $a_i = 0$ for some $i > 2$, then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2} = 1$.</p><p><b>Proof:</b> By the way $(a_n)$ is constructed in the problem statement, having two equal consecutive terms $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ implies that $a_i$ divides every term in the sequence. So $a_i | 999$ and $a_i | a_2$, so $a_i | \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$, so $a_i = 1$. For the proof of the second result, note that if $a_i = 0$, then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}$, so by the first result we just proved, $a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1$.</p><p><b>Lemma:</b> $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$.</p><p><b>Proof:</b> Suppose $(a_n)$ completed at some $i > 2000$ or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither $999$ nor $a_2$ are $0$, none of the pairs $(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})$ can have a $0$ or be equal to $(1, 1)$. So the first lemma implies\\[\\max(a_1, a_2) > \\max(a_3, a_4) > \\cdots > \\max(a_{1999}, a_{2000})  > 0,\\]so $999 = \\max(a_1, a_2) \\geq 1000$, a contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$.</p><p><br/>Now we're ready to find exactly which values of $a_2$ we want to count.</p><p>Let's keep in mind that $2006 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and that $a_1 = 999$ is odd. We have two cases to consider.</p><p><br/><b>Case 1:</b> If $a_2$ is odd, then $a_3$ is even, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is odd, so $a_6$ is even, and this pattern must repeat every three terms because of the recursive definition of $(a_n)$, so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are\\[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...,\\] so $a_{2006}$ is odd and hence $1$ (since if $(a_n)$ completes at $i$, then $a_k$ must be $0$ or $1$ for all $k \\geq i$).</p><p><b>Case 2:</b> If $a_2$ is even, then $a_3$ is odd, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is even, so $a_6$ is odd, and this pattern must repeat every three terms, so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are \\[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...,\\]so $a_{2006}$ is even, and hence $0$.</p><p><br/>We have found that $a_{2006} = 1$ is true precisely when $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ and $a_2$ is odd. This tells us what we need to count.</p><p><br/>There are $\\phi(999) = 648$ numbers less than $999$ and relatively prime to it ($\\phi$ is the Euler totient function). We want to count how many of these are odd. Note that\\[t \\mapsto 999 - t\\]is a 1-1 correspondence between the odd and even numbers less than and relatively prime to $999$. So our final answer is $648/2 = 324$, or $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$.</p>",
        "<p>As in Solution 1, we show that $a_2$ must be odd. We notice that, after experimentation, all numbers eventually end up in a sequence $1,1,0,1,1,0,\\ldots$, which points to the assumption that every $2$ out of $3$ values for $a_2$ work due to residue classes. Combining this with an estimated 50-50 chance that these values are either odd or even, since $999$ values are nonnegative integers less than $999$, we can estimate that there are about $999\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=333$ different values of $a_2$ that work. The closest answer choice by far is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }324}$.</p><p>~eevee9406</p>"
