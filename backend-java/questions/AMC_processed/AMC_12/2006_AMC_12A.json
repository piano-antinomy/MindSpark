There are 3 choices for the bug's first move from the starting vertex, and 2 choices for the bug's second move (it can't go back to the previous vertices).

After an odd number of steps, the possible points that can be reached are $B$,$D$,$G$,$E$. Then, for even-numbered steps, the remaining points can be reached.

If it starts on the upper plane, there are two possibilities for the first step, $B$ or $D$. The second and third steps are restricted to the upper plane, and the fourth step will move to the nearby point on another plane. These three steps have only one possibility each, so there is no need for classification. Then, when it reaches the lower plane, the fifth step has two possibilities, thus limiting the sixth and seventh steps as well. Proceeding in this way, the bug can also move from left to right or from front to back.

        "<p>Let $s$ be the numbers of elements in a subset. First we examine the second condition. No elements less than $s$ can be put in a subset of size $s$, therefore the \"lowest\" element that can go into the subset is $s$, whereas the \"highest\" element that can go into the subset is $15$. This is a total of $15-s+1$ or $16-s$ possible elements. </p><p>Now we consider the first condition. No consecutive elements are allowed. This means that if an element $e$ is put into the subset, both $e-1$ and $e+1$ are no longer possibilities. Assume that all subsets are ordered from least to greatest (we are looking for the number of combinations, so we can order these combinations however we want). Then the first element will be $s$ (as a reminder, the lowest possible element in a subset is $s$), the second element will be at least $s+2$, and so on. After $s$ elements are chosen, we will have skipped $s-1$ elements (these are the elements that were \"eliminated\" as they were consecutive). Therefore, we ignore exactly $s-1$ elements (if we ignore more or less elements, then $s$ changes) Since we must ignore $s-1$ elements, we can simply remove those beforehand. ($16-s)-(s-1) = 17-2s$ possible elements</p><p>Now we look for the bounds of $s$. We are looking for non-empty subsets, so $s\\ge1$. If $s$ is too large, there will not be enough non-consecutive terms between $s$ and $15$. Specifically, the highest element in a subset using \"optimal\" selection will be $s+2(s-1)$ or $3s-2$. If $3s-1>15$, that means s is too large. Therefore $3s-2\\le15$; solving for $s$ yields $s\\le5$. Now we know that $1 \\le s \\le 5$.</p><p>We want to know the number of ways to arrange $17-2s$ \"balls\" into $s$ identical \"boxes\" with at most $1$ ball per box, for $s=1$ to $s=5$. This is equivalent to $\\sum_{s=1}^{5}{17-2s \\choose s} = 405$, or $\\boxed{\\text{E}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We will split the problem into cases, and maybe one could then generalize this to arbitrary $n$. </p><p>$\\bold{Case 1}:$ ($n=15, k=1$). Then this is easy. We have $\\binom{15}{1}=15$.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 2}:$ ($n=14, k=2$). Now we have something tricky. To get a good grasp on this case, let us consider the smallest element; $2$, in the first spot. We then have $15-1=14$ numbers left. However, we cannot have the digit $3$. Hence we have to choose $2$ numbers from $14-1=13$ integers left. This can be done in $\\binom{13}{2}=78$ ways.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 3}:$ ($n=13, k=3$). As in the last case, we can use the smallest element to get a good grasp on this case. Put the digit $3$ in the first spot. Then there are $11$ integers left for the second spot. But in total, we have to avoid $2$ elements for each subset of cardinality $3$ ${a,b,c}$. So we have to choose $3$ elements from $13-2=11$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways. </p><p>$\\bold{Case 4}:$ ($n=12, k=4$). As in the previous case, we have to avoid $3$ numbers, and choose $4$ from them. Which is choosing $4$ elements from $12-3=9$ elements, which can be done in $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways.</p><p>$\\bold{Case 5}:$ ($n=11, k=4$). Now you are accustomed to the strategy. We remove $4$ integers leaving $\\binom{7}{5}=21$ ways.</p><p>Adding up all of the cases yields $405$, as in $\\boxed{E)405}$. SHEN KISLAY KAI~~2023</p><p>Note also that we only went up to cardinality or $k=5$, or else for greater $k$, we would always have consecutive numbers.</p><p>EDIT: I have coincidentally found a video solution using the exact same method: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqE9P2JEs-k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqE9P2JEs-k</a>(Also if you think I am copying, why would I have then posted the video, hm? Explain that)!</p>"
