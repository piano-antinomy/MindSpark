Since $k$ is an integer, there are only $2$ pairs of $(m,n)$ that work: $(3,42)$ and $(6,21)$. This means that there are $2$ values of $k$ such that $u$ is an integer. But looking back at $u$ in terms of $k$, we have $\\pm$, meaning that there are $2$ values of $u$ for every $k$. Thus, the answer is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(A)}$.</p>",

        "<p>Rewrite the equation$\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{14b}{9a}=k$in two different forms. First, multiply both sides by $b$ and subtract $a$ to obtain$\\frac{14b^2}{9a}=bk-a.$Because $a$, $b$, and $k$ are integers, $14b^2$ must be a multiple of $a$, and because $a$ and $b$ have no common factors greater than 1, it follows that 14 is divisible by $a$. Next, multiply both sides of the original equation by $9a$ and subtract $14b$ to obtain$\\frac{9a^2}{b}=9ak-14b.$This shows that $9a^2$ is a multiple of $b$, so 9 must be divisible by $b$. Thus if $(a,b)$ is a solution, then $b=1$, $3$, or $9$, and $a=1$, 2, 7, or 14. This gives a total of twelve possible solutions $(a,b)$, each of which can be checked quickly.$\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{14b}{9a}$will only be an integer when $(a,b) \\in \\{(1,3),(2,3), (7,3), (14,3)\\},$ for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ pairs.</p>"

Since $EA=2$, we could let $C=(2,0,2)$, $D=(2,2,2)$, and $E=(2,2,0)$. Now to get back to $A$ we need another vertex $F=(0,2,0)$. Now if we look at this configuration as if it was two dimensions, we would see a square missing a side if we don't draw $FA$. Now we can bend these three sides into an equilateral triangle, and the coordinates change: $A=(0,0,0)$, $B=(2,0,0)$, $C=(2,0,2)$, $D=(1,\\sqrt{3},2)$, and $E=(1,\\sqrt{3},0)$. Checking for all the requirements, they are all satisfied. Now we find the area of triangle $BDE$. The side lengths of this triangle are $2, 2, 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an isosceles right triangle.
