Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of $d$ on the way there, and again cover a distance of $d$ on when drawing closer. This makes sense, because from the 1st diagram to the second, the raft moves in the same direction as the boat, while from the 2nd to the 3rd, the boat and raft move in opposite directions.</p><p>Let $b$ denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and $r$ denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from $A$ to $B$, the boat travels at a velocity of $b+r$, and on the way back, travels at a velocity of $-(b-r)=r-b$, since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from $A$ to $B$ becomes $(r+b)-r=b$, and on the way back it becomes $(r-b)-r=-b$. Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, $b$ and $-b$, we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other.</p><p>From this, we have that the boat travels a distance $d$ at rate $b$ with respect to the raft both on the way to $B$ and on the way back. Thus, using $\\dfrac{distance}{speed}=time$, we have $\\dfrac{2d}{b}=9\\text{ hours}$, and to see how long it took to travel half the distance, we have $\\dfrac{d}{b}=4.5\\text{ hours}\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$</p>",

At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal.

From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional. </p><p>In the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another.

Then either $d=-a$ or $h(x)=x$.</p><p>This lemma is one that is typically known by people who could make it this far into this AMC 12 anyway (USAMO qualifiers likely). </p><p>$\\textit{Proof.}$ We plug in $h\\left (h(x)\\right )$, and equating it to $x$, we see\\begin{align*}h\\left (h(x)\\right ) &amp;=h\\left (\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\\right ) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a\\cdot \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+b}{c\\cdot \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+d} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a(ax+b)+b(cx+d)}{c(ax+b)+d(cx+d)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(a^2+bc)x+(ab+bd)}{(ac+cd)x+(bc+d^2)}=x.\\end{align*}Then if we clear the denominator, it rearranges into \\[(a^2+bc)x+(ab+bd)=(ac+cd)x^2+(bc+d^2)x\\implies (ac+cd)x^2+(d^2-a^2)x-(ab+bd)=0.\\] Since this equation is true for all $x$ (since now the fractions are gone), this implies that the coefficients of this quadratic are all equal to $0$. Focus on the condition $d^2-a^2=0$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 1:}$ $d+a=0$</p><p>Then all the other coefficients automatically become zero, so $d+a=0\\implies d=-a$ is a sufficient condition.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 2:}$ $d-a=0$ (and $d+a\\neq 0$)</p><p>Then in $ab+bd=0$, we divide both sides by $a+d$ to see that $b=0$. Similarly, in $ac+cd=0$, we divide to also see that $c=0$. Then since $d=a$, \\[h(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}=\\frac{ax+0}{0x+a}=x.\\] Therefore, in this case, it is required that $h(x)=x$, which now works. This proves our desired claim. $\\qquad \\qquad \\square$</p><p>Note that we are asking when $g(g(z))=z$. So either $g(z)=z$, or in the expansion of $g(z)=f(f(z))$, the two corresponding coefficients are negations of each other. </p><p>$\\textbf{Case 1:}$ $g(z)=z$</p><p>Then $f(f(z))=z$, so either $f(z)=z$ or the two coefficients are negative of each other. Clearly $f(z)\\neq z$, since the numerator and denominator are both degree $1$ polynomials. So we would require the coefficients, namely $1$ and $b$, to be negatives of each other. Then $b=-1$ is a possibility here, giving $|b|=1$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 2:}$ The two coefficients are negative of each other.</p><p>It can be found that \\begin{align*}f(f(x))&amp;=f\\left (\\frac{z+a}{z+b}\\right ) \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\frac{z+a}{z+b}+a}{\\frac{z+a}{z+b}+b} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{z+a+a(z+b)}{z+a+b(z+b)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(a+1)z+(ab+a)}{(b+1)z+(b^2+a)}.\\end{align*} By our lemma, we would require $a+1=-(b^2+a)$, which rearranges into $b^2=-1-2a$. But we are given that $|a|=1$. The triangle inequality for complex numbers states that $|a|+|b|\\geq |a+b|$, where equality happens when the arguments of $a$ and $b$ are equal. Here, we can see that \\[|-1-2a|\\leq |-1|+|-2a|=1+2=3,\\] but we can also find that \\[|-1-2a|+1=|-1-2a|+|1|\\geq |-2a|=2\\implies |-1-2a|\\geq 1.\\] Therefore, because $|b^2|=|-1-2a|$, then $1\\leq |b|^2\\leq 3$, giving us $1\\leq |b|\\leq \\sqrt{3}$.</p><p>When we combine the two cases, we find that the possible range of $|b|$ is $|b|\\in [1,\\sqrt{3}]$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\sqrt{3}-1}$.</p><p>~ethanzhang1001</p>"
