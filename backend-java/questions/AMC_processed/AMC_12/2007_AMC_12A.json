(In other words, this means we will carry when adding from the perfect multiple of $9$ under $n$.)Observe that when we carry, i.e. Add $1$ onto $1989$ to obtain $1990$, the units digit decreases by $9$ while the tens digit increases by $1$. This means that the sum of the digits decreases by $8$ in total, and we have $-8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$, so the \"mod 9\" of the sum increases by $1$. This means that, regardless of whether the sum carries or not, the modulo 9 of the sum of the digits always increases by $1$.</p><p>Case 1.2. The tens digits are the same, which is trivial since the units digit just increases by $1$ which means that the sum is also equivalent to $1 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>This means that $S(n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$ and similarly letting the next $n=S(n)$, $S(S(n)) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. Summing these, we have $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$. Clearly, no integers of this form will satisfy the condition because $2007$ is a perfect multiple of $9$.</p><p>Case 2. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>In this case, we apply exactly the same argument. There is at most one carry, which means that the sum of the digits will always be congruent to $2$ mod $9$. Then we can apply similar arguments to get $S(n) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$ and $S(S(n)) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$, so adding gives $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>It is trivial to see that for $n \\equiv k \\pmod 9$, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 8$, we must have $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3k \\pmod 9$. Only when $k=0, 3, 6$ is $3k$ a multiple of $9$, which means that $n$ must be a multiple of $3$.</p><p>Now, we find the integers. Again, consider two cases: Integers that are direct multiples of $9$ and integers that are multiples of $3$ but not $9$.</p><p>Case 1. $n$ is a multiple of $9$. An integer of the form $\\overline{20ab}$ will not work since the least such integer is $2007$ which already exceeds our bounds.

Solving for c yields $c \\ge 6$. Looking back at the previous equation, the floor expression is $0$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $3$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. Thus, the right-hand side is $32$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $35$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. We can solve these two scenarios as systems of equations/inequalities:</p><p>$4c+d = 32$</p><p>$c+d \\le 9$</p><p>and</p><p>$4c+d=35$</p><p>$c+d \\ge 10$</p><p>Solving yields three pairs $(c, d):$ $(8, 0)$; $(8, 3)$; and $(7, 7)$. Checking the numbers $1980$, $1983$, and $1977$; we find that all three work. Therefore there are a total of $4$ possibilities for $n$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.</p><p>Note: Although this solution takes a while to read (as well as to write) the actual time it takes to think through the process above is very short in comparison to the solution length.</p><p>~edits by vadava_lx</p>"

        "<p>We build a modified version of Markov's chain to solve this problem. First, start off by representing each element of the chosen subset with a $1$, and every other element $0$. The possible states are as follows; if the restriction was broken previously or not. For the sake of not over counting, we let the former be its own state (call it \"C\"), and the latter will be split up into more states. The previous two digits can either be $00$, $10$, or $01$. If a previous digit doesn't exist, it is $0$ for obvious reasons. We know that we start off at state \"$00$\". We have two options; include the first digit ($1$) or not ($0$). Thus, state $00$ transitions to state $01$ in $1$ case and state $00$ in $1$ case. State $01$ transitions to $10$ in $1$ case and the \"C\" state in $1$ case. State $10$ transitions to $00$ in $1$ case and state \"C\" in $1$ case. Since it doesn't matter where or how many times the restriction is broken for the subset to fail, state \"C\" can transition to itself in $2$ cases. </p><p>Notice how this corresponds to a transition matrix of $\\begin{bmatrix}  \t1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ \t0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ \t1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\         0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$. Since we start off on state $00$, our starting state matrix is$\\begin{bmatrix}  \t1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$. We wish to compute the value $a+b+c = 4096-d$ when given $f^{12}(\\begin{bmatrix}  \t1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix})=\\begin{bmatrix}  \ta & b & c & d\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$, where $f(x)$ is $x\\times\\begin{bmatrix}  \t1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ \t0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ \t1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\         0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ Through repeated applications of matrix multiplication, we obtain the output matrix of $\\begin{bmatrix}  \t60 & 41 & 28 & 3967\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$.
