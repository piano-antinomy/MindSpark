Also, the distance remaining between Alicia and Beth as they bike toward each other is proportional to their combined velocity. The combined velocity is $18t + 12t = 30t$.

So the answer is 8. It can be done even if one does not remember that 45 squared is 2025, all it takes is intuition. One can easily see mentally that 5 x 8 that is 40 squared is 1600, and then one has to do just one more computation and see that 5 x 9 that is 45 squared exceeds 2023, so the answer is 8. </p><p>~edit by RobinDaBank</p><p>Note that you can find the square of any number that ends in 5 by taking the number 5 more than it and the number 5 less than it, multiplying those together, and adding 25.

Now we know the formula for how many games are played in this tournament is $n(n-1)/2$, the sum of the first $n-1$ triangular numbers.

Note that we can generate the number of valid sequences of $A$ by first generating all sequences of $b$ such that $b_i\\leq{}b_{i+1}$ for all $1\\leq{}i<n$, then choosing the elements from $A_{k+1}$ that we keep in $A_k$, given the sequence of $b$ as the restraint for the number of elements.

In the second case, consider the last term in $b$ that is not 10 or 5, say $b_m$.

Therefore, we only need to consider sequences of $b$ where each term is $0$ $5$ or $10$.

If there exists at least one term $b_k=5$, then we use stars and bars to count the number of sequences of $b$, and each sequence of $b$ corresponds to $\\binom{10}{5}$ sequences of $A$. For each $n$, we must have at least one term of $5$. After that, there are $n-1$ stars and $2$ bars (separating $0$ to $5$ and $5$ to $10$), so that is $\\binom{n+1}{2}$ sequences of $b$. So the sum is $\\binom{2}{2}+\\binom{3}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{11}{2}=\\binom{12}{3}\\equiv0$ (mod 5). Therefore, the answer is 0 mod 5, and it must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$</p>",
