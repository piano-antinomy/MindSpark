        "<p>The problem gives a series of transformations and proceeds to give the resultant point, being $(-6,3)=P$. Therefore, all we must do is reverse it. First, we reverse the last transformation by computing the distance from the point $(-6,3)$ to $y=-x$ by using the formula $d=\\frac{|Ax+By+C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$. Where $Ax+By+C$ is the standard form of a line. Computing, we obtain that $d=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. We also know that this is magnitude is at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Therefore, to do the transformation, we double that vector and add it to the point.

To do so, realize that $P'-(1,5)\\Leftrightarrow \\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=\\left\\langle -4,1 \\right\\rangle$. Simply make this vector perpendicular by switching the $x$ and $y$ components and switching the sign of the initial $y$ component. Therefore, we get $\\overrightarrow{v_{2\\bot }}=\\left\\langle 1,4 \\right\\rangle$. Therefore, adding this vector to $(1,5)$ yields $(2,9)$, which leads us to $9-2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$.</p><p>~justgiveup JoshKosh</p>",
        "<p>Using the same method as in Solution 1, we can obtain that the point before the reflection is $(-3,6)$.

We can simplify this to the quadratic $17x^2-34x=0$. When we factor out $17x$, we find that $x = 2$ or $x = 0$. However, $x$ cannot equal $0$.Therefore, $x = 2$, and plugging this into the second equation gives us that $y = 9$.

Note that $R(x)$ can't influence the degree of the right hand side of this equation since its degree is either $1$ or $0$. Since the coefficients of the leading term in the dividend and the divisor are both $1$, that means the coefficient of the leading term of the quotient is also $1$. Thus, the leading term of the quotient is $z^{2019}$. Multiplying $z^{2019}$ by the divisor gives $z^{2021}+z^{2020}+z^{2019}$. We have our $z^{2021}$ term but we have these unnecessary terms like $z^{2020}$. We can get rid of these terms by adding $-z^{2018}$ to the quotient to cancel out these terms, but this then gives us $z^{2021}-z^{2018}$. Our first instinct will probably be to add $z^{2017}$, but we can't do this as although this will eliminate the $-z^{2018}$ term, it will produce a $z^{2019}$ term. Since no other term of the form $z^n$ where $n$ is an integer less than $2017$ will produce a $z^{2019}$ term when multiplied by the divisor, we can't add $z^{2017}$ to the quotient.

If he has $(6,1,1)$, Beth can take 2 out of the middle of $(6,1,1)$ to get $(2,2,1,1)$ which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice $A$.

If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get $(1,2,2,1)$, in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins.

We see that the average of the $30$ terms is $20$, which means that exactly $20 \\cdot 30 = 600$ lattice points above the line as desired.

Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates more than the y-value of the lower x-coordinates. So, we turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ for which the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20$. The point $(30,20)$ is already counted, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will first hit the point $(28,19)$ since $(28, \\frac{56}{3})$ is the closest to it.
