Through observation and logic, we can then conclude that (x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 32. After expanding and simplifying the expressions, you end up with x+y=10. If you then solve for x in terms of y, you end up with x=10=y. Since 8 is the diagonal of the original rectangle, we can write that (10-y)^2+y^2=64. Use the quadratic formula to solve for y, and then solve for x. Using either root, yields a product of the difference of squares, 25-7=18. Therefore, 18 (E) is our solution!</p><p>~Namya</p>"

To find the circumradius we have: \\[\\text{Circumradius} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}}\\]If we let $a = 7, b = 24, c = 20, \\text{and}, d = 15$, that means that the semi-perimeter is just \\[\\dfrac{7+24+20+15}{2} = 33\\].

Thus, the triangle is a $45-45-90$ isosceles triangle.This conclusion can also be reached by cutting the bottom square across a diagonal and noticing that each resulting triangle is congruent to each triangle wedged between the hexagons by symmetry.

        "<p>Since the $13$ cards are picked up in two passes, the first pass must pick up the first $n$ cards and the second pass must pick up the remaining cards $m$ through $13$. Also note that if $m$, which is the card that is numbered one more than $n$, is placed before $n$, then $m$ will not be picked up on the first pass since cards are picked up in order. Therefore we desire $m$ to be placed before $n$ to create a second pass, and that after the first pass, the numbers $m$ through $13$ are lined up in order from least to greatest.</p><p>To construct this, $n$ cannot go in the $n$th position because all cards $1$ to $n-1$ will have to precede it and there will be no room for $m$. Therefore $n$ must be in slots $n+1$ to $13$.Let's do casework on which slot $n$ goes into to get a general idea for how the problem works.</p><p><b>Case 1:</b> With $n$ in spot $n+1$, there are $n$ available slots before $n$, and there are $n-1$ cards preceding $n$. Therefore the number of ways to reserve these slots for the $n-1$ cards is $\\binom{n}{n-1}$. Then there is only $1$ way to order these cards (since we want them in increasing order). Then card $m$ goes into whatever slot is remaining, and the $13-m$ cards are ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$, giving only $1$ way.

Therefore the number of ways to reserve slots for these cards are $\\binom{n+1}{n-1}$. Then there is one way to order these cards. Then cards $m$ and $m+1$ must go in the remaining two slots, and there is only one way to order them since they must be in increasing order. Finally, cards $m+2$ to $13$ will be ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$, which yields $1$ way. Therefore, this case has $\\binom{n+1}{n-1}$ possibilities.</p><p>I think we can see a general pattern now. With $n$ in slot $x$, there are $x-1$ slots to distribute to the previous $n-1$ cards, which can be done in $\\binom{x-1}{n-1}$ ways. Then the remaining cards fill in in just $1$ way. Since the cases of $n$ start in slot $n+1$ and end in slot $13$, this sum amounts to:\\[\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \\cdots + \\binom{12}{n-1}\\] for any $n$.</p><p>Hmmm ... where have we seen this before?</p><p>We use wishful thinking to add a term of $\\binom{n-1}{n-1}$:\\[\\binom{n-1}{n-1}+\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \\cdots + \\binom{12}{n-1}\\]</p><p>This is just the hockey stick identity!

Since we know $a-b$ is equal to $2$, $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})$ would become $2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106$. Simplifying more, we would get $a^{2}+ab+b^{2}=15553$.</p><p>Now let's introduce another variable. Instead of using $a$ and $b$, we can express the primes as $x+2$ and $x$ where $a$ is $x+2$ and b is $x$. Plugging $x$ and $x+2$ in, we would have $(x+2)^{2}+x(x+2)+x^{2}$. When we expand the parenthesis, it would become $x^{2}+4x+4+x^{2}+2x+x^{2}$. Then we combine like terms to get $3x^{2}+6x+4$ which equals $15553$.

        "<p>The first element of subset $S$ must be $1$. Nothing between $1$ and $25$ can possibly add up to $1$, so that's your first number.

        "<p>The total number of possible systems is $2^9 = 512$, with $8$ possible sets of coefficients per equation. We will use complementary counting to find the number of systems which only have the solution $(0, 0, 0)$ and subtract that from the total. Similar to what is observed in Solution 3, if any equation is repeated or $0x + 0y + 0z = 0$, there will only be two or fewer equations for three variables, making one unique solution impossible. Therefore, we must choose $3$ different equations from $7$ possible ones, giving $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 210$ systems. However, there are two exceptions to consider, which will have more than one solution. The first is of the form $x + y + z = 0$, $x + y = 0$, $z = 0$; the second is of the form $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $x + y = 0$. In both cases, there are $3$ ways to choose the variables in the equations, and then $6$ ways to arrange them, giving $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 36$ exceptions.
