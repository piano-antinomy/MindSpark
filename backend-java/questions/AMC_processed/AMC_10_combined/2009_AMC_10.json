We need to use some larger coins. Let's try: 1 nickel + 3 pennies = 5 + 3 = 8\u00a2 (too small), 2 nickels + 2 pennies = 10 + 2 = 12\u00a2 (too small), 3 nickels + 1 penny = 15 + 1 = 16\u00a2 (too large). We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>B) 25\u00a2: 1 quarter = 25\u00a2, but we need 4 coins. 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 25 + 3 = 28\u00a2 (too large). 5 nickels = 25\u00a2, but we need exactly 4 coins. 4 nickels + 1 penny = 20 + 1 = 21\u00a2 (too small). 3 nickels + 2 pennies = 15 + 2 = 17\u00a2 (too small). We cannot make exactly 25\u00a2 with 4 coins either.</p><p>Wait, let me reconsider. The problem asks which total value could NOT be made. Let me check more carefully:</p><p>A) 15\u00a2: Can we make 15\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins? 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins. We need 4 coins. 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17\u00a2 (too large). 3 nickels = 15\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>B) 25\u00a2: 1 quarter = 25\u00a2, but we need 4 coins. 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 28\u00a2 (too large). 5 nickels = 25\u00a2, but we need exactly 4 coins. 4 nickels + 1 penny = 21\u00a2 (too small). We cannot make exactly 25\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>C) 35\u00a2: 1 quarter + 1 dime = 35\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins. 1 quarter + 1 dime + 2 pennies = 37\u00a2 (too large). 3 dimes + 1 nickel = 30 + 5 = 35\u00a2, but that's only 4 coins. Wait, 3 dimes + 1 nickel = 30 + 5 = 35\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins. This is possible.</p><p>D) 45\u00a2: 1 quarter + 2 dimes = 25 + 20 = 45\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. 1 quarter + 2 dimes + 1 penny = 46\u00a2 (too large). 4 dimes + 1 nickel = 40 + 5 = 45\u00a2, but that's 5 coins. We cannot make exactly 45\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>E) 55\u00a2: 2 quarters + 1 nickel = 50 + 5 = 55\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. 2 quarters + 1 nickel + 1 penny = 56\u00a2 (too large). 1 quarter + 3 dimes = 25 + 30 = 55\u00a2, but that's only 4 coins. Wait, 1 quarter + 3 dimes = 25 + 30 = 55\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins. This is possible.</p><p>So the values that cannot be made with exactly 4 coins are: A (15\u00a2), B (25\u00a2), and D (45\u00a2). But the problem asks for which one could NOT be made, implying only one answer. Let me check more carefully:</p><p>Actually, let me list all possible combinations of 4 coins and see what totals we can make:</p><p>4 pennies = 4\u00a2</p><p>3 pennies + 1 nickel = 8\u00a2</p><p>2 pennies + 2 nickels = 12\u00a2</p><p>1 penny + 3 nickels = 16\u00a2</p><p>4 nickels = 20\u00a2</p><p>3 nickels + 1 dime = 25\u00a2</p><p>2 nickels + 2 dimes = 30\u00a2</p><p>1 nickel + 3 dimes = 35\u00a2</p><p>4 dimes = 40\u00a2</p><p>3 dimes + 1 quarter = 55\u00a2</p><p>2 dimes + 2 quarters = 70\u00a2</p><p>1 dime + 3 quarters = 85\u00a2</p><p>4 quarters = 100\u00a2</p><p>And combinations with pennies: 3 pennies + 1 dime = 13\u00a2, 2 pennies + 1 nickel + 1 dime = 17\u00a2, 1 penny + 2 nickels + 1 dime = 21\u00a2, etc.</p><p>Looking at the options: A) 15\u00a2 - not in our list, B) 25\u00a2 - possible (3 nickels + 1 dime), C) 35\u00a2 - possible (1 nickel + 3 dimes), D) 45\u00a2 - not in our list, E) 55\u00a2 - possible (3 dimes + 1 quarter).</p><p>So A (15\u00a2) and D (45\u00a2) cannot be made. But the problem asks for which one could NOT be made, implying only one answer. Let me check if I missed any combinations.</p><p>Actually, let me be more systematic. The problem is asking which total value could NOT be the total value of the four coins. Let me check each option:</p><p>A) 15\u00a2: Can we make 15\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins? Let's try: 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins.

We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>Therefore, the answer is A) 15\u00a2.</p>"

      "solutions": [
        "<p>The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.</p><p>For $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$.

And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.</p>",
        "<p>Notice that $2$ is a prime factor of an integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is even. Therefore, given any sufficiently high positive integral value of $k$, dividing $I_k$ by $2^6$ yields a terminal digit of zero, and dividing by 2 again leaves us with $2^7 \\cdot a = I_k$ where $a$ is an odd integer.Observe then that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}7}$ must be the maximum value for $N(k)$ because whatever value we choose for $k$, $N(k)$ must be less than or equal to $7$.</p><p>\"Isn't this solution incomplete because we need to show that $N(k) = 7$ can be reached?\"</p><p>An example of 7 being reached is 1000064. 1000064 divided by $2^7=128$ is 7813.</p><p>In fact, 1000064 is the ONLY $N(k)$ that satisfies $7$. All others are 6 or lower, because if there are more zeroes, to be divisible by 128 ($2^7$), the last 7 digits must be divisible by 128, but 64 isn't. Meanwhile, if there are less zeroes, we can test by division that they do not work.</p>",
        "<p>As in the first solution, the number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2} 2^{k+2} + 2^6$. Factor $2^6$ out of the expression to get $I_k = 2^6(1+2^{k-4}5^{k+2})$.</p><p>You can now easily see that $I_k$ is divisible by at least 6 factors of two, from $2^6$.

Since numbers divisible by 2 end in 0,2,4,6, or 8, the expression is not divisible by 2 and will not contribute to the total.</p><p>If $x=0$, the expression evaluates to $15626$.

        "<p>Similar to the other solutions, notice that $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2}+64 \\Rightarrow 2^{k+2}5^{k+2}+2^6$. Factoring out $2^6$ we see that</p><p>$I_k = 2^6(2^{k-4}5^{k+2}+1)$</p><p>Notice that for $k < 4$, $2^{k-4}$ will not be an integer, and will \"steal\" some $2$'s from the $2^6$. We don't want this to happen, since we want to maximize the exponent of $2$. We start by considering $k = 4$. Then</p><p>$I_k = 2^6(*5^6+1) \\Rightarrow 2^6(5^6+1)$</p><p>$5^6$ is an odd number; more specifically, it ends in $25$ (all powers of $5$ after $5^1$ end in $25$). Therefore the value in the parentheses will be some large number that ends in $26$. Considering the rules of divisibility, we find that $5^6+1$ is even, so it is divisible by $2$. Now our exponent of $2$ is at $7$. But the divisibility rule for $4$ is the last $2$ digits of the number must be divisible by $4$. We know the last digits: $26$, which is not divisible by $4$. Therefore $5^6 + 1$ is divisible by $2$, but not $4$. Testing more values of $k$, we find that for $k \\ge 5$, the last digit becomes $1$, which means it is not even divisible by $2$. Therefore the highest possible exponent of $2$ that we can reach is $7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $m=k+2$. $v_2(10^m+2^6)=6$ if $m>6$ and $v_2(10^m+2^6)=m$ if $m<6$. However, if $m=6$, then $v_2(10^6+2^6)=v_2(2^6(5^6+1))=6+v_2(5^6+1)$. By LTE, $v_2(5^6-1)=v_2(5-1)+v_2(5+1)+v_2(6)-1=2+1+1-1=3$. Since $v_2(5^6-1)=3$, $v_2(5^6+1)$ must equal $1$. So, the answer is $6+1=7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$</p>",
        "<p>Note that if $k<5$, then $I_k$ is not divisible by $64=2^6$. However, if $k=5$, then $1000064$ is divisible by $64$. So, we can write $I_k$ for $k=5$ as $I_5=64(1+15625)=2^6(1+15625)$. For $k=5$, we see that $I_5=2^6(1+15625)=2^6(15626)$, which is divisible by $2^7$, because there is already a $2^6$ and the $15626$ only adds one more factor of $2$ (the last two digits of $15626$, $26$, are not divisible by $4$). For $k>5$ or $k\\geq6$, there are $(k-5)$ zeroes trailing behind $15625$, giving $I_k=2^6(1+156250...0)$. $156250...0$ is clearly even if there is at least one zero. Then, adding the extra $1$ to the even $156250...0$ gives $156250...01$, which is odd. Thus, for $k>5$, $I_k=2^6(156250...01)$, which is only divisible by $2^6$.

From here, we can write the expression $6^2 + (8 - \\sqrt{25 + x^2})^2 = 5^2 + x^2 \\implies 36 + (64 - 16\\sqrt{25 + x^2} + 25 + x^2) = 25 + x^2 \\implies 100 - 16\\sqrt{25 + x^2} \\implies \\sqrt{25 + x^2} = \\frac{25}{4} \\implies 25 + x^2 = \\frac{625}{16} \\implies 400 + 16x^2 = 625 \\implies 16x^2 = 225 \\implies x = \\frac{15}{4}$. Now, remember $CE \\neq \\frac{15}{4}$. $x = \\frac{15}{4} = ME$, since we set $x = ME$ in the start of the solution.

        "<p>A decagon can be formed from the trapezoids and the base. The sum of the decagon's angles is $180(10-2)=1440^\\circ$. Letting the larger angle in each trapezoid be $x$, the two angles formed by the line each measures $(180-x)^\\circ$. There are $8$ congruent angles left. Each of those angles measures $(360-2x)^\\circ$. Putting it all together: $8(360-2x)+2(180-x)=1440\\implies x=\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A)\\ }100^\\circ}$.</p>",
        "<p>If we reflect the arch across the line, we form an 18-gon. $\\frac{180*(18-2)}{18} = 160^\\circ$ so each interior angle of the 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. Let $x$ be the degree measure of the larger interior angle of a trapezoid. From the diagram, we see that $2x + 160 = 360$, so $2x = 200$ and $x = 100$, or $\\boxed{A}$.</p>"

        "<p>There are two possible stripe orientations for each of the six faces of the cube, so there are $2^6 = 64$ possible stripe combinations. There are three pairs of parallel faces so, if there is an encircling stripe, then the pair of faces that does not contribute uniquely determines the stripe orientation for the remaining faces. In addition, the stripe on each face that does not contribute may be oriented in either of two different ways. So a total of $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$ stripe combinations on the cube result in a continuous stripe around the cube. The required probability is $\\frac {12}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac {3}{16}}$.</p><p>Without loss of generality, orient the cube so that the stripe on the top face goes from front to back. There are two mutually exclusive ways for there to be an encircling stripe: either the front, bottom and back faces are painted to complete an encircling stripe with the top face's stripe or the front, right, back and left faces are painted to form an encircling stripe. The probability of the first case is $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^3 = \\frac 18$, and the probability of the second case is $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^4 = \\frac {1}{16}$.
