The rope outlines a circular boundary that the dog may dwell in. Arrangement $I$ allows the dog $\\frac12\\cdot(\\pi\\cdot8^2) = 32\\pi$ square feet of area. Arrangement $II$ allows $32\\pi$ square feet plus a little more on the top part of the fence. So we already know that Arrangement $II$ allows more freedom - only thing left is to find out how much. The extra area can be represented by a quarter of a circle with radius 4. So the extra area is $\\frac14\\cdot(\\pi\\cdot4^2) = 4\\pi$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } II,\\,\\textrm{ by }\\,4\\pi}$.</p>"

        "<p>We can extend line $DE$, meeting line $AB$ at $G$. Similarly, we can extend line $DF$ to meet line $BC$ at $H$. We can see with some simple math that triangle $ADG$ is a $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle, so we can call line $AG$ as $x$, line $DG$ as $x\\sqrt{3}$, and line $AD$ as $2x$ (because of the $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle side proportions). </p><p>We can also see that line $AD$ is a base of rhombus $ABCD$, and line $DH$ is a height. Since triangle $DHC$ is also a $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle, line $DH$ is also $x\\sqrt{3}$. Since the question told us that the area of rhombus $ABCD$ is $24$, we can make the following equation:</p><p>$2x \\cdot x\\sqrt{3} = 24$</p><p>Solving for x:</p><p>$2x^2\\sqrt{3} = 24$</p><p>$x^2\\sqrt{3} = 12$</p><p>$x^2 = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p>$x^2 = 4\\sqrt{3}$</p><p>$x = 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p><br/>Since the question is to find the area of rhombus $BFDE$, to find the answer, we can just multiply base $DE$ with the rhombus's height. We'll start by finding the height: instantly we can see that $GB$ is the height. Since all the sides of a rhombus are equal, and we found earlier that the side length is $2x$, if $AG$ is $x$, that means $GB$ is the same length as $AG$ - that is to say, </p><p>$GB = AG = 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p><br/>Now to find the base.
