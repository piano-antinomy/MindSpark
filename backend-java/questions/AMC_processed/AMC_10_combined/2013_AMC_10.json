        "<p>Let us use mass points:Assign $B$ mass $1$. Thus, because $E$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $A$ also has a mass of $1$. Similarly, $C$ has a mass of $1$. $D$ and $E$ each have a mass of $2$ because they are between $B$ and $C$ and $A$ and $B$ respectively. Note that the mass of $D$ is twice the mass of $A$, so $AP$ must be twice as long as $PD$. PD has length $2$, so $AP$ has length $4$ and $AD$ has length $6$. Similarly, $CP$ is twice $PE$ and $PE=1.5$, so $CP=3$ and $CE=4.5$. Now note that triangle $PED$ is a $3-4-5$ right triangle with the right angle $DPE$.

We can then create a system of equations:\\[1=-2x+y+75\\]\\[2=x-3y+75\\]Solving yields $x=59$ and $y=44$.
