        "<p>We can say the area of one small square is $x^2$, so $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the area of the large square is $4x^2$ so the area of the large square is $16x^2$, so each side is $4x$ so the length of the rectangle is $4x$ and the width of the rectangle is also $4x$. $4x-x=3x$ so $\\dfrac{4x}{3x}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$</p>",

        "<p>Since the number of balls Tyrone and Eric have a specific ratio when Tyrone gives some of his balls to Eric, we can divide the total amount of balls by their respective ratios. Altogether, they have $97+11$ balls, or $108$ balls, and it does not change when Tyrone gives some of his to Eric, since none are lost in the process. After Tyrone gives some of his balls away, the ratio between the balls is $2:1$, and added together is $108$. The two numbers add up to $3$ and we divide $108$ by $3$, and the outcome is $36$. This is the number of balls Eric has, and so doubling that results in the number of balls Tyrone has, which is $72$. $97-72$ is $25$, and $36-11$ is $25$, thus proving our statement true, and the answer is $\\boxed{D=25}$.</p>"

      "solutions": [
        "<p>Tony works $2$ hours a day and is paid $0.50$ dollars per hour for each full year of his age. This basically says that he gets a dollar for each year of his age. So if he is $12$ years old, he gets $12$ dollars a day. We also know that he worked $50$ days and earned $630$ dollars. If he was $12$ years old at the beginning of his working period, he would have earned $12 * 50 = 600$ dollars. If he was $13$ years old at the beginning of his working period, he would have earned $13 * 50 = 650$ dollars. Because he earned $630$ dollars, we know that he was $13$ for some period of time, but not the whole time, because then the money earned would be greater than or equal to $650$. This is why he was $12$ when he began, but turned $13$ sometime during the six month period and earned $630$ dollars in total. So the answer is $13$.The answer is $\\boxed{D}$. We could find out for how long he was $12$ and $13$. $12 \\cdot x + 13 \\cdot (50-x) = 630$. Then $x$ is $20$ and we know that he was $12$ for $20$ days, and $13$ for $30$ days. Thus, the answer is $13$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $x$ equal Tony's age at the end of the period. We know that his age changed during the time period (since $630$ does not evenly divide $50$). Thus, his age at the beginning of the time period is $x - 1$.</p><p>Let $d$ be the number of days Tony worked while his age was $x$. We know that his earnings every day equal his age (since $2 \\cdot 0.50 = 1$). Thus, \\[x \\cdot d + (x - 1)(50 - d) = 630\\] \\[x\\cdot d + 50x - x\\cdot d - 50 + d = 630\\] \\[50x + d = 680\\] \\[x = \\dfrac{680 - d}{50}\\]Since $0 < d <50$, $d = 30$. Then we know that $50x = 650$ and $x = \\boxed{(D) 13}$</p>",
        "<p>Since Tony worked for $50$ days, he has worked for $100$ hours. Let $k$ be his hourly wage. Then, we know that $100k = 630$. </p><p>Dividing both sides by $50$, we get that $2k$(Daily wage, which is equal to his age) $\\approx$ $12.6$. Since we now know that his age was either 12 or 13 during the 6 month span, and we are asked to find his age at the end of this time, the answer is $\\boxed{(D) 13}$</p>"

Recall that to find the previous term, we must add a square number such that it is less than the next square number. $a + n^2 < (n+1)^2$. For this to be true, $a < 2n + 1$. What that means is that given a term $a$, we can find the previous term by adding $n^2$ where $n > \\frac {a-1}{2}$. </p><p><br/>For example, to find the term that precedes $167$, we know that $n>166/2 = 83$. Therefore, $n=84$ and the previous term is $167 + 84^2 = 7223$. The last digit of $7223$ is $3 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3}$</p>"

The two remaining numbers must automatically go to the two spots remaining on the bottom row, and likewise there is only one way to arrange them. For example, if I picked 5 and 8 to go in the 2 spots in the rightmost square, I would have one of these two charts (there were two ways to arrange the 2 and 3 in the chart): \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&2&5\\\\ \\hline 3&4&8\\\\ \\hline 6&7&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\;\\;\\; \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 1&3&5\\\\ \\hline 2&4&8\\\\ \\hline 6&7&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]So, the number of ways to make a chart where the middle number is 4 is $2 \\cdot \\binom{4}{2} = 2\\cdot6 = 12$ ways.</p><p>For the case when the middle is 6, it is exactly symmetric to the middle being 4 but on the opposite side. 7 and 8 must be in the bottom middle and right middle squares because if you tried to put any other number in those two squares that number would have to be bigger than 7 and 8 but smaller than 9. So there are 2 ways to arrange 7 and 8 (because they can flip themselves) and 4 choose 2 ways to choose two numbers (out of 2, 3, 4, and 5) to go in the two spaces available on the leftmost column. Again, the remaining two numbers will be forced to go in only one way on the two spaces available on the top row, meaning there are also $12$ ways to make a chart with the middle number being 6. Example- 7 and 8 are in the bottom middle and right middle squares respectively and I chose 2 and 3 to be the numbers on the two spots on the leftmost column:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&4&5\\\\ \\hline 2&6&8\\\\ \\hline 3&7&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]</p><p>The case when the middle is 5 is the hardest case. The numbers 2, 3, and 4 will fill in spaces from the top left until the diagonal with 5, and either the top right or bottom left square will be left blank (no blanks before that because the box must increase). So there are 2 choices which one to leave blank:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&&\\\\ \\hline &5&\\\\ \\hline x&&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\;\\;\\; \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 1&&x\\\\ \\hline &5&\\\\ \\hline &&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]There are 3 choices for the box (either 2, 3, or 4) immediately next to the blank box between 1 and the blank box and the other 2 numbers (from 2, 3, or 4) will sort themselves. For example, if I chose the blank box to be the bottom left box and I chose the number immediately next to the blank box to be 2, the grid would look like this:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&3&4\\\\ \\hline 2&5&\\\\ \\hline &&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]Now there are 2 empty spaces in either the rightmost or the bottommost row (the row with the square you chose to be blank and 9) and 1 empty space in the middle of the other row with 9 and a value of 2, 3, or 4. Example- the two empty spaces are marked with an p and the one empty space in the other row is marked with a q:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&3&4\\\\ \\hline 2&5&q\\\\ \\hline p&p&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]Finally, pick either 6, 7, or 8 to fill the box marked q (the one empty space between a value of 2, 3, or 4) and the remaining two numbers from 6, 7 or 8 will sort itself in the two boxes marked with a p. This is 3 choose 1 = 3 ways. Thus, there are 2 ways to choose the blank box, 3 ways to choose the number (2, 3, or 4) between the blank box and 1, and 3 ways to choose the box on the opposite side of the number between the blank box and 1, and all the other numbers are forced to arrange themselves in 1 way. This means there are $2\\cdot3\\cdot3=18$ ways to make a chart with 5 in the middle.</p><p>The answer to the problem is $12+12+18 = \\boxed{\\text{(D) }42}$ ways to make a chart in total.</p><p>~unhappyfarmer</p>"

        "<p>Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders.

The sum of the Raiders scores is $a(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3})$ and the sum of the Wildcats scores is $4a+6d$. Now we can narrow our search for the values of $a,d$, and $r$.

Solve for $a$ in both equations in terms of $r$ and set them equal to each other:</p><p>$\\frac{r - (6n + 1)}{4} = \\frac{r}{1 + m + m^2 + m^3}.$ We know $1 + m + m^2 + m^3$ can't be $4$ because then $n$ would be a fraction. So let's try $15$:</p><p>$\\frac{r - (6n + 1)}{4} = \\frac{r}{15} \\implies 11r = 90n + 15.$ We know $r$ has to be a multiple of 15 for $a$ to be an integer.
