Since $q$ and $p$ are both positive integers with $q>p$, $(q-p)$ and $(q+p)$ also must be, and thus, they are both factors of $141$. We have two choices for pairs of factors of $141$: $1$ and $141$, and $3$ and $47$. Assuming the former pair, since $(q-p)$ must be less than $(q+p)$, $q-p=1$ and $q+p=141$. Solve to get $p=70, q=71$. Since $p^2+300$ is not a perfect square, this is not the correct pair. Solve for the other pair to get $p=22, q=25$. This time, $p^2+300=22^2+300=784=28^2$. This is the correct pair. Now, we find the percent increase from $22^2=484$ to $28^2=784$.

        "<p>This problem is a direct application of the chromatic polynomial of a graph, represented by $P_k(G)$, which returns a polynomial representing the number of ways to color a graph $G$ with $k$ colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In other words, it gives us a polynomial in terms of $k$ where we can plug in $k=6$ to get our answer.  </p><p>Well, if we want to find $P_k$ for a graph $G$, we should probably first draw the graph, right? We can first draw five vertices (without any edges) in the shape of a pentagon. After connecting the diagonals, we get a star. We attempt to shift the vertices around to simplify the graph, which we quickly realize is isomorphic (can be turned into) the five-cycle, or the pentagon.  </p><p>Finding $P_k$ on a graph with a cycle of length at most 3 is straightforward -- we first pick a vertex v. It has 0 colored (visited) neighbors, so we can color it in k ways. We then move on to the vertices adjacent to v, etc, and at the end we multiply all these together. For example, the chromatic polynomial of a triangle is $k(k-1)(k-2)$. However, cycles with length > 3 introduce ambiguity, and thus the above technique fails. Thus, we need to use the recursive formula $P_k(G) = P_k(G-e)-P_k(G*e)$, where $G-e$ represents removing e and $G*e$ represents contracting e, or collapsing the two endpoints of e into one. When we hit a graph where the longest cycle has length 3, we can use the first technique to quickly find $P_k$. </p><p>After about four iterations of the algorithm, we get that the chromatic polynomial is $k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3 + k(k-1)(k-2)$.

      "question": "<p>Let $R$ be a unit square region and $n \\geq 4$ an integer. A point $X$ in the interior of $R$ is called <i>n-ray</i> partitional if there are $n$ rays emanating from $X$ that divide $R$ into $n$ triangles of equal area. How many points are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point). </p><p>We first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas. </p><p>Let the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional. </p><p>In the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2320}$.</p>",
        "<p>Position the square region $R$ so that the bottom-left corner of the square is at the origin. Then define $s$ to be the sidelength of $R$ and $X$ to be the point $(rs, qs)$, where $0<r,q<1$. </p><p><br/>There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of $R$. The areas of the four triangles formed by these rays are then $A_1=\\frac{qs\\times s}{2}$, $A_2=\\frac{(s-rs)\\times s}{2}$, $A_3=\\frac{(s-qs)\\times s}{2}$, and $A_4=\\frac{rs\\times s}{2}$. </p><p><br/>If a point is $n$-ray partitional, then there exist positive integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a+b+c+d=n$ and $\\frac{A_1}{a}=\\frac{A_2}{b}=\\frac{A_3}{c}=\\frac{A_4}{d}$. Substituting in our formulas for $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, and $A_4$ and canceling equal terms, we get \\[\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{1-r}{b}=\\frac{1-q}{c}=\\frac{r}{d}.\\]</p><p><br/>Taking $\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{1-q}{c}$ and solving for $q$, we get $q=\\frac{a}{a+c}$, and taking $\\frac{1-r}{b}=\\frac{r}{d}$ and solving for $r$, we get $r=\\frac{d}{b+d}$. Finally, from $\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{r}{d}$, we have $qd=ar$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $\\frac{ad}{a+c}=\\frac{ad}{b+d}$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $a+c=b+d$. </p><p><br/>So for a point $X$ to be $100$-ray partitional, $a+b+c+d=100$, so $a+c=b+d=50$. $X$ must then be of the form $\\left(\\frac{d}{50}s, \\frac{a}{50}s\\right)$. Since $X$ is in the interior of $R$, $a$ and $d$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $49$ (with $b$ and $c$ just equaling $50-d$ and $50-a$, respectively). Thus, there are $49\\times 49=2401$ points that are $100$-ray partitional.</p><p><br/>However, the problem asks for points that are not only $100$-ray partitional but also not $60$-ray partitional. Points that are $60$-ray partitional are of the form $\\left(\\frac{m}{30}s, \\frac{n}{30}s\\right)$, where $m$ and $n$ are also positive integers. We count the number of points $\\left(\\frac{d}{50}s, \\frac{a}{50}s\\right)$ that can also be written in this form. For a given $d$, $\\frac{d}{50}=\\frac{m}{30}$ if and only if $m=\\frac{3}{5}d$, and likewise with $a$ and $n$. We can then see that a point is both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional if and only if $a$ and $d$ are both divisible by $5$. There are $9$ integers between $1$ and $49$ that are divisible by $5$, so out of our $2401$ points that are $100$-ray partitional, $9\\times 9=81$ are also $60$-ray partitional.</p><p><br/>Our answer then is just $2401-81=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2320}$.</p>",
        "<p>For the sake of simplicity, let $R$ be a $60 \\times 60$ square and set the bottom-left point as the origin. Then, $R$ has vertices: \\[(0,0), (60,0), (60,60), (0,60).\\]</p><p>Now, let a point in the square have coordinates $(x, y).$</p><p>In order for the point to be $100-$ ray partitional, we must be able to make $100$ triangles with area $60^2/100 = 36.$ For it to not be $60$-ray partitional, we cannot make $60$ triangles with area $60^2/60 = 60.$</p><p>When we draw such a triangle, it's base will always be on one of the sides of the square. If it is on the bottom side, then the height must be $y$. So, the base of each triangle must be $\\frac{72}{y}.$ So, there will be $\\frac{60}{\\frac{72}{y}} = \\frac{60y}{72}$ total triangles on that side.</p><p>If the triangle is on the right side of the square, then the height has to be $60 - x.$ So, the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-x}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-x)}{72}$ triangles.</p><p>If the triangle is on the top, the height will be $60-y$, the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-y}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-y)}{72}$ triangles along this side.</p><p>The triangles on the left will have height $x$, base $\\frac{72}{x}$ and $\\frac{60x}{72}$ such triangles must exist. </p><p>Simplifying, we get $\\frac{5y}{6}, \\frac{5 (60-x)}{6}, \\frac{5(60-y)}{6}, \\frac{5x}{6}$ triangles on the respective sides of the square. </p><p>All of these numbers must be integers. Let $x = 60a$ and $y = 60b$ where $0 < a, b < 1.$</p><p><br/>Then, the amounts become: \\[50a, 50b,  50 - 50a, 50 - 50b.\\]</p><p>As long as $50a$ and $50b$ are integers, $50 - 50a$ and $50 - 50b$ will also be integers. </p><p>For this to happen, $a$ and $b$ must be of the form $\\frac{x}{50}$ where $1 \\le x \\le 49.$ So, we have a total of $49^2 = 2401$ points that are $100$-ray partitional. </p><p>Now, we must calculate the number of $100$- ray partitional points that are also $60$-ray partitional. </p><p>Using a method similar to before, if a point is $60$-ray partitional, then we must be able to make $30a, 30b, 30 - 30a, 30 -30b$ triangles on the different sides. </p><p>So, $30a$ and $30b$ must be integers. This means $a$ and $b$ have to be of the form $\\frac{y}{30}$ where $0<y<30.$</p><p>If a point is both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional, then it can be written as \\[\\frac{x}{50} =  \\frac{y}{30}\\]. Note that whenever $x$ is divisible by $5$, a $y$ will always exist to satisfy the above equation.</p><p>So, $x$ has to be in the range $(0, 50)$ and must be divisible by $5$. There are $9$ possibilities, namely $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.$</p><p>The $x$-coordinate of the point and the $y$-coordinate of the point can each use any of these $9$ possibilities, giving $9^2 = 81$ numbers that are both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional.</p><p>Overall, we are left with $2401 - 81 = \\boxed{2320}$ solutions.</p>",
        "<p>If $X$ is $100-ray$ partitional, and there are $n$ triangles on a side, then the total area of those $n$ triangles will be $\\frac{n}{100}$. Since the side has length $1$, then the length of the altitude from $X$ to that side will be $\\frac{n}{50}$.</p><p><br/>There will be 1 unique way to split this side into bases of triangles with height $\\frac{n}{50}$, and also 1 unique split into triangles on the opposite side. Since $n$ can range from $[1,49]$, there will be $49$ different distances from $1$ side, and $49$ different distances from an adjacent side, for a total of $49\\cdot 49 = 2401$ $100-ray$ partitional points. </p><p><br/>Similarly, for a point to be $60-ray$ partitional, the distance from the sides should be of the form $\\frac{k}{30}$. For this point to also be $100-ray$ partitional, it must also be of the form $\\frac{z}{50}$. Clearly, the only possible values of $k$ are $(3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27)$ for a total of 9 ways, so there are $9\\cdot 9 = 81$ points that are $60-ray$ partitional and $100-ray$ partitional.</p><p><br/>Subtracting $81$ from $2401$, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2320}$. </p><p>-skibbysiggy</p>"

Simplifying, we get $3w-3z+x-y=28$. Adding $w+x+y+z=44$ and $(w-x)+(w-y)+(w-z)+(x-y)+(x-z)+(y-z)=28$, we get $4w+2x-2z=72$, and simplifying we get $2w+x-z=36$. Since $x-z$ is one of our positive differences, we can start guessing values for $w$, and if the equation simplifies to one of our numerical positive differences, that value of $w$ should work. We can start at $w=18$ and keep going down, because our sum has to be positive. For $w=18$, $x-z=0$, which is not one of our sums. For $w=17$, $x-z=2$,which is not one of our sums. For $w=16$, $x-z=4$, which is one of our sums, so 16 works. For $w=15$, $x-z=6$, which is one of our sums, so 15 works. For $w=14$, $x-z=8$, which is not one of our sums. If we keep going, $x-z$ will soon exceed 10 and exceed all our sums, so any value below $w=14$ will not work. Therefore, our only solutions for $w$ are 15 and 16, which means our sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$. You can check that 15 and 16 work by forming a string of 4 numbers as shown above.</p>",
        "<p>Because we know that $w>x>y>z$ and that the positive differences are $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9$, we can immediately come to the conclusion that $w-z= 9$ (because w is the largest integer and z is the smallest integer, so their difference must be the greatest). With this we have $3$ equations, we have that $x+y+z+w=44$ (from the problem), $w-z=9$ and because we can add up all the possible possible differences (as shown in the previous solutions), we get that $3w+x-y-3z=28$. With these equations, we eventually manipulate these equations by doing the first equation minus 3 times the second to get $x-y=1$. We can also add the first and third equation and subtract the second equation to get $w+x=27$ thus we know that $w-x$ can be $3, 4, 5,$ and $6$ (note: 1 and 9 are not possible because we know that $x-y=1$ and $w-z=9$ and the remaining differences can only be taken by 1 pair, so $w-x$ cannot be equal to 1 or 9). However, in order to get an integer value for x and z, we find that $w-z$ can only be equal to 3 and 5. Thus, by solving these, we see that $w= 15$ and $w=16$. $15+16=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$.</p>"

        "<p>Notice that the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ won't be affected by $2000$. Essentially we could solve the problem by finding the hundreds digit of $11^{2011}$. Powers of $11$ are special because they can be represented by the Pascal's Triangle. Drawing the triangle, there is a theorem that states the powers of $11$ can be found by reading rows of the triangle and adding extra numbers up. [add source] For example, the sixth row of the triangle is $1, 5, 10, 10, 5,$ and $1$. Adding all numbers from right to left, we get $161051$, which is also $11^5$. In other words, each number is $10^n$ steps from the right side of the row. The hundreds digit is $0$. We can do the same for $11^{2011}$, but we only need to find the $3$ digits from the right. Observing, every $3$ number from the right is $1 + 2 + 3... + n$. So to find the third number from the right on the row of $11^{2011}$, \\[f(11^n) = 1 + 2 + 3... + (n-1),\\] or $\\frac{(2010 \\cdot 2011)}{2}$, or $2021055$. The last digit is five, but we must remember to add the number on the right of it, which, by observing other rows is obviously $2011$. We must carry the $1$ in $2011$'s tens digit to the $5$ in $2021055$'s unit digit to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 6}$. The one at the very end of the row doesn't affect anything, so we can leave it alone.</p><p><br/>-jackshi2006</p>",

      "question": "<p>A lattice point in an $xy$-coordinate system is any point $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are integers. The graph of $y = mx +2$ passes through no lattice point with $0 < x \\le 100$ for all $m$ such that $\\frac{1}{2} < m < a$. What is the maximum possible value of $a$?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>For $y=mx+2$ to not pass through any lattice points with $0<x\\leq 100$ is the same as saying that $mx\\notin\\mathbb Z$ for $x\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$, or in other words, $m$ is not expressible as a ratio of positive integers $s/t$ with $t\\leq 100$. Hence the maximum possible value of $a$ is the first real number after $1/2$ that is so expressible.</p><p>For each $d=2,\\dots,100$, the smallest multiple of $1/d$ which exceeds $1/2$ is $1,\\frac23,\\frac34,\\frac35,\\dots,\\frac{50}{98},\\frac{50}{99},\\frac{51}{100}$ respectively, and the smallest of these is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{50}{99}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We see that for the graph of $y=mx+2$ to not pass through any lattice points, the denominator of $m$ must be greater than $100$, or else it would be canceled by some $0<x\\le100$ which would make $y$ an integer. By using common denominators, we find that the order of the fractions from smallest to largest is $\\text{(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)}$. We can see that when $m=\\frac{50}{99}$, $y$ could be an integer, so therefore any fraction greater than $\\frac{50}{99}$ would not work, as substituting our fraction $\\frac{50}{99}$ for $m$ would produce an integer for $y$. So now we are left with only $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$. But since $\\frac{51}{101}=\\frac{5049}{9999}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}=\\frac{5050}{9999}$, we can be absolutely certain that there isn't a number between $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$ that can reduce to a fraction whose denominator is less than or equal to $100$. Since we are looking for the maximum value of $a$, we take the larger of $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{50}{99}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We want to find the smallest $m$ such that there will be an integral solution to $y=mx+2$ with $0<x\\le100$. We first test A, but since the denominator has a $101$, $x$ must be a nonzero multiple of $101$, but it then will be greater than $100$.

        "<p>By constructing the bisectors of each angle and the perpendicular radii of the incircle the triangle consists of 3 kites. </p><p>Hence $AD=AF$ and $BD=BE$ and $CE=CF$.

        "<p>Proceeding similarly to the first solution, we have that sides of each triangle are of the form $a, a+1, a+2$ for some number $a$. Also, note that the perimeter of each triangle is half of the previous one. In order for the triangle to not exist, it must not satisfy the triangle inequality, meaning that $a + a + 1 < a+2 \\Rightarrow a<1$. Then, the perimeter would be $a + a + 1 + a + 2 = 3a + 3 < 6$. So, to have a proper triangle, we have $\\frac{3018}{2^{k}} > 6 \\Rightarrow 2^k < 503 \\Rightarrow 2^{k} < 512$. The first triangle to not work would have perimeter $\\frac{3018}{256} = \\frac{1509}{128}$, thus the answer is  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\frac{1509}{128}}$.</p>",
        "<p>This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$. Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$. Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$, and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$. If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$. Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$, we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$, is indeed equal to $\\frac{P_1}{2}$. Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \\frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$, $P_n = \\frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$. Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$, we get that $P_n = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$. If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us:First Sequence:$x_1 < 2012$</p><p>$x_2 < 2013$</p><p>$x_3 < 2011$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is:$x_1 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$</p><p>$x_2 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$</p><p>$x_3 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$. Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when:$2^{n-2} < 503$(You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$. If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$, we see that $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$(and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\\boxed{D}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"
