Notice also that 2016 is divisible by 3. This means if we can find a pattern for every even number that is divisible by 3, we can find the answer for 2016. The first three even numbers that are divisible by 3 from zero are 6, 12, and 18. There are 2 ways for 6, 3 ways for 12, and 4 ways for 18 (5 for 24, 6 for 30, and 7 for 36). The pattern here is that the number of ways for any even number X that is divisible by 36 is X/6 + 1. It turns out this pattern holds for every X number.

        "<p>The center of dilation must lie on the line $A A'$, which can be expressed as $y = \\dfrac{4x}{3} - \\dfrac{2}{3}$. Note that the center of dilation must have an $x$-coordinate less than $2$; if the $x$-coordinate were otherwise, then the circle under the transformation would not have an increased $x$-coordinate in the coordinate plane. Also, the ratio of dilation must be equal to $\\dfrac{3}{2}$, which is the ratio of the radii of the circles. Thus, we are looking for a point $(x,y)$ such that $\\dfrac{3}{2} \\left( 2 - x \\right) = 5 - x$ (for the $x$-coordinates), and $\\dfrac{3}{2} \\left( 2 - y \\right) = 6 - y$. We do not have to include absolute value symbols because we know that the center of dilation has a lower $x$-coordinate, and hence a lower $y$-coordinate, from our reasoning above. Solving the two equations, we get $x = -4$ and $y = - 6$. This means that any point $(a,b)$ on the plane will dilate to the point $\\left( \\dfrac{3}{2} (a + 4) - 4, \\dfrac{3}{2} (b + 6) - 6 \\right)$, which means that the point $(0,0)$ dilates to $\\left( 6 - 4, 9 - 6 \\right) = (2,3)$.

        "<p>$x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{ x \\}$ so we have \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} \\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor.\\] Clearly, the value of $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ changes only when $x$ is equal to any of the fractions $\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{2}{k} \\dots \\frac{k-1}{k}$. To get all the fractions, graphing this function gives us $46$ different fractions. But on average, about one is every three fractions are repetitions of another fraction (see below). This means there are a total of $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ different possible values of $f(x)$.</p><p>Note: This is because all fractions with denominators $2\\le k \\le 5$ are repetitions of another fraction with denominator $2k,$ which is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of all the fractions. Also, some other repeated fractions are scattered around the fractions with higher denominators. This means that we can safely estimate that about $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the fractions are repetitions of another fraction.</p>",
        "<p>Solution $1$ is abstract.

In total, $f(x)$ will increase by $3$. Because $\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{3}{9}$, these $3$ numbers are actually $1$ distinct number to cause $f(x)$ to change. In general, when $x$ increases from $\\frac{m}{n}-\\epsilon$ to $\\frac{m}{n}$, $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ will increse from $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} -1$ to $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n}$ if $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n}$ is an integer, and the value of $f(x)$ will change.

Now, notice that the value of $n/k$ can take $k-1$ values (excluding 0) since $n$ must be strictly less than $k$.

Notice that whenever the value of $(1/2)x_f$ changes, the value of $(1/8)x_f$ must change. This means that every case in $k=2$ is covered by $k=8$. This is extended to every number that is a factor of another (3 and 9, 5 and 10). Therefore, we can eliminate $k=2,3,4,5$ as they are all factors of other values of $k$, which eliminates 10 cases. </p><p>Within the remaining numbers, there are a couple of numbers that can still have repeating values. These are $(6, 9)$, $(6, 8)$, and $(8,10)$. The first one repeats when $n/k$ is equal to $1/3$ or $2/3$, eliminating 2 cases, and the second and third repeat whenever $n/k$ is equal to $1/2$. This eliminates another 2 cases.</p><p>Therefore, our final answer is $45+1-10-2-2=32$, which is $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$.</p>"
