We want to find factors $x$ and $y$ where $y>x$ such that $\\frac{y}{x}$ is minimized, as $720 \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}$ will then be the least possible value of $b$. After experimenting, we see this is achieved when $y=16$ and $x=15$, which means our value of $b$ is $720 \\cdot \\frac{16}{15} = 768$, so our sum is $7+6+8=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 21}$.</p><p>~i_am_suk_at_math_2</p>",
        "<p>To minimize the value of $b$, where it has to be an integer, and it has to be greater than 720, we can express the common ratio as $\\dfrac{n+1}{n}$, where the value has to be greater than $1$, and $n$, and $n+1$ have to be factors of 720. Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for $n$, where itself and $n+1$ are factors of $720$. From here, we can check whether $n(n+1) = 720$ yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of $720$, which is $360$. $n(n+1) = 360$, this doesn't have an integer root either. So, then we check the next biggest factor which is $240$, $n(n+1) = 240$, which we get $15$ as a root. This means the common ration is $\\dfrac{16}{15}$. We then multiply $\\dfrac{16}{15}$ times $720$ and add up the digits getting $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 21}$.</p><p>~yuvag</p>",
        "<p>Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $\\frac{x}{y}$, with $x>y$. This means that $720(\\frac{x}{y})$ and $720(\\frac{y}{x})$ must both be integers, therefore $x$ and $y$ are both factors of $720$. We would achieve the smallest ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$ if $x$ and $y$ are consecutive, so by listing out the factors of $720$, we find that $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, $15$, $16$ are the only consecutive factors (any factors larger than these would result in the ratio simplifying, making it larger than just using consecutive integers). $15$ and $16$ are the largest, so we find the common ratio to be $\\frac{16}{15}$, making $b=720(\\frac{16}{15})$ giving us $768$.

Then, we look for the closest possible fraction-ratio out of the primes, and after a quick look, its easy to see it is $16$ and $15$.

This means that there will be $2024/10$ or $202R4$ whole loops in the subset $S,$ implying that there will be $202*3 = 606$ elements in S.

We don't factor it yet - we are going to find $x$ again using the Pythagorean Theorem. Similarly, finding MA is just the square root of the squares of AY and MY individually, or $\\sqrt{(8 - 2x)^2 + (4 - x)^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 32x + 4x^2 + 16 - 8x + x^2} = \\sqrt{5x^2 - 40x + 80}$.

However, one of $x,y,z$ must be the median since the middle four numbers in the original set are all non-integral. As a result, we can eliminate $2.2$ since the sum would be too small to allow for one of $x,y,z$ to be the median (notice that negative numbers are not permitted since the range would be greater than $7$). This leaves two cases.</p><p>For the $x+y+z=20.2$ case, notice that all three must be less than or equal to $8$ due to the range restriction.

Thus we let the median be $y$. Since adding a number to each side of the set would not change the median, we know that the median must fall between the two middle numbers $3.2,5.2$. Then we find two triples $(0.1,4,7.1)$ and $(0,5,6.2)$, resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}$.</p><p>~eevee9406</p>",
        "<p>We can start doing casework on the numbers. Notice that the median can either be four, five or six because there has to be one or two numbers on one side.

Notice that the sum of the numbers (not including $x, y, z$ is $24.8$. To make this mean an integer, $x+y+z$ must have a decimal $0.2$ when added up. Now, plugging in our values into the mean gets us $35.8+2a=9k$ for some integer $k$. Notice that $0\\leq a\\leq 1$, so the only value for $a$ is $0.1$, so we found our first ordered triplet, $(0.1, 4, 7.1)$. Let’s make the median $5$ now. Then we have to put $x$ and one side and $z$ on the other to “balance” the numbers, or make it so that there are 4 numbers on each side of $5$. Now, we can see that $x$ is $0$, and solving for $z$, we get that $z=6.2$. We get our second triple is $(0, 5, 6.2)$. Now coming to our third case scenario, we use $6$ as the median. Clearly it means that $x$ has to be the median, so that $y$ and $z$ can be on the same side as $x$. \\[1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.2, 6, 6.2, y, 7, z\\] We will use this diagram.

        "<p>It is easiest to do casework on the range.

As we'll see, the problem will become simpler this way. Since we want integer mean, first note the sum of the values given to be $24.8$: when we add $x,y,z$, it must be a multiple of $9$ to yield an integer mean. Also remember that the median of an increasing list of $9$ numbers is the fifth number.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 1:}$</p><p>Since $x<1$, $z<7$, $x$ must be the minimum of this list of numbers and $7$ is the max: so the range is $7-x$. This must be equal to $7$, so $x=0$. Now we try to make the median an integer.With $x=0$, the fifth smallest number currently is $5.2$, which is clearly not an integer. But if we stick $y$ or $z$ in between $3.2$ and $5.2$, then the median will be an integer. So let one of $y,z$ be $4$: then the sum of all the numbers we have so far is $28.8$. To make this a multiple of $9$, the last number has to be $7.2$ to add up to $36$. However, we said that $z<7$, so this violates the bounds of this case. So then we set $y=5$, so our sum is $29.9$: then $z=36-29.9 = 6.2$. Here everything checks out, so for this case there is one solution: $(0,5,6.2)$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 2:}$</p><p>Since $x>1$ and $z<7$, the minimum is $1$ and the maximum is $7$. Thus the range is always $6$, but we need the range to be $7$, so this case has no solutions.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 3:}$</p><p>We have $x<1, z>7$. Our minimum is $x$ and our maximum is $z$, so the range is $z-x = 7$. Since $x<1$, the median still falls on $5.2$, so $y$ can be either $4$ or $5$ to make the median an integer. For now, suppose $y=4$. Our sum is now $28.8+x+z$, which we set to the nearest multiple of $9:$ $36$. Thus $x+z = 7.2$. Now we have a system of equations: we add them to get $2z = 14.2 \\implies z = 7.1 \\implies x = 0.1$. Since the values of $z$ and $x$ satisfy our case, this is a possible solution.</p><p>Now suppose $y=5$. Our sum is $29.8+x+z$, which must be equal to $36$, so $x+z = 6.2$. Adding the equations, we have $2z = 13.2 \\implies z = 6.6$. But this violates our assumption that $z>7$, so this has no solutions.</p><p>Therefore this case has one solution: $(0.1,4,7.1)$.</p><p>$\\textbf{Case 4:}$</p><p>Since $x>1, z>7$, the max is $z$ and the min is $1$.

        "<p>Firstly, I interpreted the problem algebraically. In other words, let ${x}$ be an integer. Since we're raising it to the ${100}$th power and ${100}$ is even, we don't have to worry about negative values of ${x}$. Now, we break ${125}$ into three factors of ${5}$. I first considered this when we're dividing by ${5}$. Okay so we can write the problem as below:</p><p>$x^{100}\\equiv r \\bmod{5}$. Now, in the world of mod(5), everything is much easier to figure out. Take $x\\equiv 0 \\bmod{5}$. Now, obviously $x^{100}$ will bring up a remainder of ${0}$ if ${x}$ itself is a multiple of 5. Now, $x\\equiv 1 \\bmod{5}$. In this case, notice how $1^{100}$ is congruent to 1 in the mod(5) world. So in this case, we would have a remainder of 1. Considering $x\\equiv 2 \\bmod{5}$, it's a little more tricky. Notice $2^{100}$ is equal to $1024^{10}$ and ${1024}$ is 1 less than a multiple of 5. So ${1024}$ will be congruent to $-1 \\bmod{5}$ and raising it to the power of 10 will bring up a remainder of 1 yet again. Similarly, is $x\\equiv 3 \\bmod{5}$ or $x\\equiv 4 \\bmod{5}$, you would notice both these cases will bring up a remainder of 1 again. So in the mod(5) world, we seem to only have remainders of ${0}$ and ${1}$. Interesting!Therefore, since ${125}$ is just ${3}$ factors of ${5}$, we may say that in mod(125), we would have the same exact remainders namely ${0}$ and ${1}$. Therefore, we would only have ${2}$ possible remainders. This brings an answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\; 2}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"

(For certain Chinese versions, this also proves that $P(2026)$ is an integer.)</p><p>If $m$ is odd, $\\frac{m}{2}$ will result in $\\frac{1}{2}$. Building off of each term will give you $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{8}$, and $\\frac{1}{8}$, and summing those up will grant $1$, an integer. This means in the problem, $P(2023)$ and $P(2025)$ will also result in integer answers.</p><p>In general, all integer $m$ will make $P(m)$ give an integer answer, but for this question, this will get us to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }4}$ integer values ($\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }5}$ for certain Chinese versions of the test).</p><p>~unpogged</p>",
        "<p>Obviously $P(2022)$ and $P(2024)$ works. $2023 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 8$, and $2023 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. Restating the problem, we have the equation equivalent to $\\frac{4m+2m^2 + m^4 + m^8}{8}$. Plugging in $m=-1$, we have $-4+2+1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, so $P(2023)$ works. Plugging in $m=1$, we have $4+2+1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ as well, so $P(2025)$ also works. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{E}$.</p><p>~martianrunner</p>"
