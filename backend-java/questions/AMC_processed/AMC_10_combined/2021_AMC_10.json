This implies the $\\text{total possible region}$ is a square with side length $8 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 7$, with an area of $49$. Now, we consider cases where needs to land to partially cover a black region.</p><p><b> Near The Center Square </b></p><p>We can have the center of the coin land within $\\frac{1}{2}$ outside of the center square, or inside of the center square.

The four quarter circles combine to make a full circle of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the area is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

By symmetry, we can just find the successful region for one of them, then multiply by $4$. Consider the above diagram. We can draw an altitude from the bottom corner of the square to hit the hypotenuse of the green triangle. The length of this when passing through the black region is $\\sqrt 2$, and when passing through the white region (while being contained in the green triangle) is $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, we have to subtract off when it doesn't pass through the red square. Then, it's the hypotenuse of a small isosceles right triangle with side lengths of $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ which is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$ So, the altitude of the green triangle is $\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt 2 + 1}{2}$. Then, recall, the area of an isosceles right triangle is $h^2$, where $h$ is the altitude from the right angle. So, squaring this, we get $\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt 2}{4}$. Now, we have to multiply this by $4$ to account for all of the black triangles, to get $3 + 2\\sqrt 2$ as the final area for this case. </p><p><b> Finishing </b></p><p>Then, to have the coin touching a black region, we add up the area of our successful regions, or $8 + 4\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 3 + 2\\sqrt 2 = 11 + 6\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{4}$.

        "<p>Consider the following, much simpler game.</p><p>Arjun and Beth can each either take 1 or 2 bricks from the right-hand-side of a continuous row of initially $n$ bricks.It is easy to see that for $n$ a multiple of 3, Beth can \"mirror\" whatever Arjun plays: if he takes 1, she takes 2, and if he takes 2, she takes 1. With this strategy, Beth always takes the last brick. If $n$ is not a multiple of 3, then Arjun takes whichever amount puts Beth in the losing position.</p><p>The total number of bricks in the initial states given by the answer choices is $8, 9, 10, 10, 11$. Thus, answer choice $\\textbf{(B)}$ appears promising as a winning position for Beth. The difference between this game and the simplified game is that in certain positions, namely those consisting of fragments of size only 1, taking 2 bricks is not allowed. We can assume that for the starting position $(6, 2, 1)$, Beth always has a move to ensure that she can continue to mirror Arjun throughout the game. (This could be proven rigorously with lots of casework. In particular, she must avoid providing Arjun with a position of 3 continuous bricks, because then he could take the middle block and force a win.) The assumption seems reasonable, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We can start by guessing and checking our solutions. Let's start with $A$, $(6,1,1)$. Arjun goes first, and he has a winning strategy. His strategy is to cut the 6 block in half, so whatever Beth does, Arjun will copy. If we see this in practice, Arjun has made the block in to $(2,2,1,1)$. If Beth takes 1, he will take one. If Beth takes 2, he will take 2 as well.</p><p>Then, we can guess solution $B$, $(6,2,1)$. If Arjun starts by taking 1 of the blocks, he will either have $(6,1,1)$, $(6,2)$, $(x,y,2,1)$ (Where $x+y = 5$). If he has $(6,1,1)$, Beth can take 2 out of the middle of $(6,1,1)$ to get $(2,2,1,1)$ which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice $A$. If he has $(6,2)$, Beth will take out one from the edge, and we get $(5,2)$. Beth can now copy whatever Arjun does, so she will win. </p><p>Next, if he takes one out to get $(x,y,2,1)$, we can either have $(4,1,2,1)$ or $(3,2,2,1)$. If it is the first case, Beth can take the edge 2 out of the 4, which gives us $(2,1,2,1)$ and whatever Arjun does, Beth can do, so she has established a win. If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get $(1,2,2,1)$, in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins. So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$</p><p>~Arcticturn</p>"

If $300$ lattice points are below the line, then around $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the area formed by $S$ is under the line. By using the formula for a triangle's area, we find that when $x=30, y \\approx 20.$ Solving for $m$ assuming that $(30, 20)$ is a point on the line, we get $m = \\frac{2}{3}.$ Plugging in $m$ to $\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor mx \\rfloor),$ we get:</p><p>\\[\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}x \\rfloor) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 18 + 18 + 19 + 20\\]</p><p>We have a repeat every $3$ values (every time $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ goes through a lattice point).

If $m$ was lower, $y=mx$ would no longer go through some of these points, and there would be less than $300$ lattice points under it.</p><p>Now, we find an upper bound for $m.$ Imagine increasing $m$ slowly and rotating the line $y=mx,$ starting from the lower bound of $m=\\frac{2}{3}.$The upper bound for $m$ occurs when $y=mx$ intersects a lattice point again (look at this problem to get a better idea of what's happening: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2011_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_24\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2011_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_24</a>).</p><p>In other words, we are looking for the first $m > \\frac{2}{3}$ that is expressible as a ratio of positive integers $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q \\le 30.$ For each $q=1,\\dots,30$, the smallest multiple of $\\frac{1}{q}$ which exceeds $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $1, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{3}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\cdots , \\frac{19}{27}, \\frac{19}{28}, \\frac{20}{29}, \\frac{21}{30}$ respectively, and the smallest of these is $\\frac{19}{28}.$</p><p>Alternatively, see the method of finding upper bounds in solution 2.</p><p>The lower bound is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and the upper bound is $\\frac{19}{28}.$ Their difference is $\\frac{1}{84},$ so the answer is $1 + 84 = \\boxed{85}.$</p><p>~JimY~Minor edits by sl_hc</p><p>An alternative would be using Farey fractions and the mediant theorem to find the upper bound. $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{7}{10}$ gives $\\frac{9}{13},$ and so on using Farey addition.</p><p>An alternative approach with the same methodology can be done using Pick's Theorem.

        "<p>Based on area ratios between a square of side length $30$ and a triangle with base $30$, we estimate that the slope $m$ of the line we want is approximately $\\frac{2}{3}$. Following this estimate, we see if there are approximately $30 \\cdot 30 - 300 = 600$ lattice points above the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$.</p><p>Counting the number of lattice points with $x=1$ above the line, the number of lattice points with $x=2$ above the line, and so on, we find that the total number of lattice points above the line is $30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \\ldots+ 10$, with the even integers repeating every third term. We see that the average of the $30$ terms is $20$, which means that exactly $20 \\cdot 30 = 600$ lattice points above the line as desired. This gives a lower bound because any decrease in the slope of the line would cause points that were already on the line to shift to being above it.</p><p>To find the upper bound, notice that each lattice point less than $1$ unit above the line is either $\\frac{1}{3}$ or $\\frac{2}{3}$ above. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates more than the y-value of the lower x-coordinates. So, we turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ for which the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20$. The point $(30,20)$ is already counted, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will first hit the point $(28,19)$ since $(28, \\frac{56}{3})$ is the closest to it. The equation of the line which goes through both the origin and $(28,19)$ is $y=\\frac{19}{28}x$.
