So our total sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$.Note that we have counted all possibilities, because the largest positive positive power of 3 must be greater than or equal to the largest negative positive power of 3, for the number to be nonnegative.</p>",
        "<p>This solution has a similar idea to that of above.We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$:If $a_7 = -1$, we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$'s for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$. This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$, we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$. However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$, $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$.If $a_{7}=0$, we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$, we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$. Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$. Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$, and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$. Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.If $a_{7}=1$, we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$, we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$. So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$, we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$. So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$. In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$, $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$. We can now start building up our values for $S$: $S_{0} = 2$ ($a_{0} = 0, 1$), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$. So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \\boxed{3281}$, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.~advanture</p>",

Call this set $A$ and call $\\{1999, 2000, 2001, \\cdots , 2018 \\}$ set $B$. Let's do casework on the element of $A$ that we choose. Since $1\\cdot 1=1$, any number from $B$ can be paired with $1$ to make $1^n$ have a units digit of $1$. Therefore, the probability of this case happening is $\\frac{1}{5}$ since there is a $\\frac{1}{5}$ chance that the number $1$ is selected from $A$. Let us consider the case where the number $3$ is selected from $A$. Let's look at the unit digit when we repeatedly multiply the number $3$ by itself:\\[3\\cdot 3=9\\]\\[9\\cdot 3=7\\]\\[7\\cdot 3=1\\]\\[1\\cdot 3=3\\]We see that the unit digit of $3^x$, for some integer $x$, will only be $1$ when $x$ is a multiple of $4$. Now, let's count how many numbers in $B$ are divisible by $4$. This can be done by simply listing:\\[2000,2004,2008,2012,2016.\\]There are $5$ numbers in $B$ divisible by $4$ out of the $2018-1999+1=20$ total numbers. Therefore, the probability that $3$ is picked from $A$ and a number divisible by $4$ is picked from $B$ is $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{5}{20}=\\frac{1}{20}.$Similarly, we can look at the repeating units digit for $7$:\\[7\\cdot 7=9\\]\\[9\\cdot 7=3\\]\\[3\\cdot 7=1\\]\\[1\\cdot 7=7\\]We see that the unit digit of $7^y$, for some integer $y$, will only be $1$ when $y$ is a multiple of $4$. This is exactly the same conditions as our last case with $3$ so the probability of this case is also $\\frac{1}{20}$. Since $5\\cdot 5=25$ and $25$ ends in $5$, the units digit of $5^w$, for some integer, $w$ will always be $5$. Thus, the probability in this case is $0$.The last case we need to consider is when the number $9$ is chosen from $A$. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{5}.$ We list out the repeating units digit for $9$ as we have done for $3$ and $7$:\\[9\\cdot 9=1\\]\\[1\\cdot 9=9\\]We see that the units digit of $9^z$, for some integer $z$, is $1$ only when $z$ is an even number. From the $20$ numbers in $B$, we see that exactly half of them are even. The probability in this case is $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{10}.$Finally, we can add all of our probabilities together to get \\[\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2}{5}}.\\]</p><p>~Nivek</p><p>~very minor edits by virjoy2001</p>",

        "<p>First of all, we can quickly calculate the base area $EBCH$ to be $\\sqrt{13}$, since $BC = 1$ (given) and $EB = \\sqrt{2^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$ (Pythagorean Theorem).</p><p>Now all we need is to find the height of $EBCHM$, which we can denote as $h$. We know that the length of the altitude from $M$, $F$, and $G$ to base $EBCH$ is $h$, and that's the length that will be easiest to use to find the height. To make this problem simpler, you can turn this 3D model into a 2D one (look at face $EABF$).</p><p>Looking at face $EABF$, $h$ would be equal to the length of the altitude from $F$ to $EB$. To find this, we can find the coordinates of $F$ and the point where the altitude from $F$ touches $EB$, which we will call point $X$. Immediately, we know that the coordinates of $F$ are $(3,2)$, given the values on the rectangle, and we can find the coordinates of point $X$ by first noticing that the equation of $EB$ is $y = \\dfrac{-2x}{3}+2$. Because of perpendicular slopes being the inverse reciprocal of the original slope, the equation for FX is $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}-\\dfrac{5}{2}$. From this, $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}+b$, and $2=\\dfrac{3(3)}{2}+b$, so $b = \\dfrac{-5}{2}$. Now the intersection of these two equations can be found to be $(\\dfrac{27}{13},\\dfrac{8}{13})$. We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points. $\\sqrt{(3-\\dfrac{27}{13})^2 + (2-\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\sqrt{(\\dfrac{12}{13})^2+(\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13}$. </p><p>Now that we know the height length and base area of the pyramid $EBCHM$, we can use the volume formula for it: $\\dfrac{\\text{(base area)} \\cdot \\text{(height length)}}{3} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{3}$ $= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 2}$</p><p>~Nate1212121</p><p><br/></p>"

Thus it repeats every four. Consider the sequence after the 1st term and we have 2017 numbers. Divide $2017$ by four to get $504$ remainder $1$.

        "<p>Preamble: In this solution, we define the sequence $A$ to satisfy $a_n = f(n),$ where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term of the sequence $A.$ This solution will show a few different perspectives. Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated. </p><p>To begin, we consider the sequence $B$ formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between $A.$ Define $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.$ Notice that for $n \\ge 4,$ we have </p><p> Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that $b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.$</p><p>If you didn\u2019t notice that $B$ repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence $b_n$ so that you could define $c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.$ Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that $c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.$ The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is $0,$ in which you have that $b_{n} = b_{n+6}.$ In the case in which finite differences didn\u2019t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of $C$ to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence. Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \\ldots\\] in which the same result follows. </p><p>Using the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully. Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \\ldots\\] (If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.)</p><p>Now, there are two ways to finish. </p><p>Finish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \\cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$</p><p>Finish Method #2: Notice that $a_{2018} = a_{2017} - a_{2016} + 2018 = B_{2016} + 2018 = -1 + 2018 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$</p><p>~Professor-Mom</p>",
