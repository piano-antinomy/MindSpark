The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$. After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$, so the inradius is $4$. Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$. Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$. The distance $OA$ is $6$, because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$, because it is the radius of the incircle.

        "<p>The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$. After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$, so the inradius is $4$. Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$. Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$. The distance $OA$ is $6$, because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$, because it is the radius of the incircle.

In a short amount of time, you will see that $n$ is not an integer from that equation, but thats perfectly okay since we can just find an $n$ that gets it close to 2019, then we can work from there. From inspection, you will see that a good n value that does that exact job is $37$. </p><p>We can then deduce that the start point of the $37$th block will be $1+(6+15+24..+321) = 5887$ if we refer to fact $1$. We can easily find the length of 37th block by $36*3+1 = 109$ if we refer to fact $2$. Remember that the length increases by $3$ for each block. So we then can deduce that our endpoint for the 37th block is $5887+109-1 = 5995$. The endpoint of the $37$th block will be the $2035$th number said because we can plug $37$ into $n(3n-1)/2$, which tells us how many numbers Tadd has said where $n$ is the number of blocks Tadd has. From there we know that the $2019$th number is in $37$th block, so that means we can take our endpoint and subtract $2035-2019 = 16$ from the endpoint of the $37$th block, which is $5995$, so we get $5995-16 = 5979$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$.~~triggod</p>"

        "<p>First we have to solve the area of the non-shaded area(the semicircles) that are in Circle $F$.The middle semicircle has area $\\frac12\\pi$ and the other two have about half of their are inside the circle = $\\frac14\\pi\\ + \\frac14\\pi\\ + \\frac12\\pi\\ = \\pi$. Then we subtract the part of the quartercircle that isn't in Circle $F$. This is an area equal to that of a triangle minus an minor segment. The height of the triangle is the radius of the semicircles, which is $1$. The length is the radius of Circle $F$ minus the length from the center of the middle semicircle up to until it is on the edge of the circle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem we can figure out that the length is: \\[\\sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}.\\] This means that the length of the triangle is $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ and so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2}$. For the area of the segment, it's the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle. The triangle's length is the radius of $F$: $2$, while its height is the radius of the semicircles: $1$, so the area is 1. The angle is $30^{\\circ}$ as the hypotenuse is the radius of $F$ and the opposite side is the radius of the semicircles, which means the area is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the whole area, which is $4\\pi$ so the area of the sector is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and the area of the segment is $\\frac{\\pi}{3} - 1$ and so the area of the part of the quartercircles that stick out of Circle $F$ is: \\[(\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2})-(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - 1) = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3}.\\]</p><p>Since there are two, one for each side, we have to multiply it by 2, so we have ${4 - \\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, which we subtract from $\\pi$ which gets us $\\frac{5\\pi}{3} - 4 + \\sqrt{3}$ which we subtract from $4\\pi$ $=$ $\\frac{12\\pi}{3}$, which is $\\frac{7\\pi}{3} + 4 - \\sqrt{3}$ so we get $7+3+4+3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 17}$.</p>"

For Debra to see the second tail before the second head, her first flip can't be heads, as that would mean she would either end with double tails before seeing the second head, or would see two heads before she sees two tails. Therefore, her first flip must be tails. The shortest sequence of flips by which she can get two heads in a row and see the second tail before she sees the second head is $THTHH$, which has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{32}$. Furthermore, she can prolong her coin flipping by adding an extra $TH$, which itself has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since she can do this indefinitely, this gives an infinite geometric series with a first term of $\\frac{1}{32}$ and a common ratio of $\\frac{1}{4}$, which means the answer (by the infinite geometric series sum formula) is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{32}}{1-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{24}}$.</p><p>You have $THT$...(insert any # of pairs of HT)...HH.

Then \\[x_{n} - x_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n-4}{x_n+6} = \\frac{f_n}{10 + f_n} \\approx \\frac{f_n}{10}.\\]Now notice that we want to find $m$, such that $x_m \\leq 4 + \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$, and $x_0 = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^0}$. We are going to find an approximate number of steps to go from $4 + \\frac{1}{2^i}$ to $4 + \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$. If $x_j = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^i}$, then $f_j = \\frac{1}{2^i}$ and if $x_k = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$, then $f_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$. Then \\[x_j - x_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \\approx \\frac{f_j}{10} + \\frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \\frac{f_{k-1}}{10}.\\]Furthermore, \\[\\frac{1}{2^i} = f_j > f_{j+1} > f_{j+2} > ... > f_{k-1} > f_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}.\\] Therefore, \\[(k-j) \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^i}}{10} > \\frac{f_j}{10} + \\frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \\frac{f_{k-1}}{10} > (k-j) \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}}{10},\\] so $5 < k-j < 10$.

Using the above steps to evolve the situation from i = 1 to i = 6, we get $n(A_{6}) = 37, n(B_{6}) = 37, n(C_{6}) = 28, n(D_{6}) = 49$.Since the sequence ends with 0, we only need to sum $n(A_{6})$ and $n(C_{6})$, which yields $37+28=65$. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }65}$</p><p>Solution by ~Cc2010cc2015</p><p>minor edit by ~CLA</p>",
        "<p>We define a sequences of $01$ ($a$) or $011$ ($b$). Observe that we can put the the $a$'s and $b$'s in any way and we meet all the different requirements. Note that this can be found through just playing around with the problem's mechanics. Now we can see a big problem. With sequences of $a$ and $b$, the main sequence always end with a $1$. '</p><p>Now a simple fix is just to add zero to the end of the sequence, shortening it effectively to 18 undecided digits. Now we have multiple cases.</p><p>\\begin{align*}18 &amp;= 9a + 0b &amp;\\rightarrow \\dfrac{(9+0)!}{9!} \\\\&amp;= 6a + 2b &amp;\\rightarrow \\dfrac{(6+2)!}{6!}\\\\&amp;= 3a + 4b &amp;\\rightarrow \\dfrac{(3 + 4)!}{4!}\\\\&amp;= 0a + 6b &amp;\\rightarrow \\dfrac{(0+6)!}{6!}\\\\\\end{align*}</p><p><br/>(Here's how I was able to see this, I put a zero, than I have to put a one, and then I can put a one or a zero. Then I saw that after every zero, a certain pattern repeats.)</p><p>- Created by wiselion\u00a0:)</p>"
