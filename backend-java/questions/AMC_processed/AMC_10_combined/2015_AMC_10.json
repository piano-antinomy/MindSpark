        "<p>The circumference of the clock is twice that of the disk. So, a quarter way around the clock (3:00), the point halfway around the disk will be tangent. The arrow will point to the left. We can see the disk made a 75% rotation from 12 to 3, and 3 is 75% of 4, so it would make 100% rotation from 12 to 4. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$. Similarly, the arrow would be pointing downward at 6:00. It would already have completed three 180 degree turns. Therefore, two 180 degree turns would be completed at 4:00.</p><p><br/></p>",
        "<p>The rotation factor of the arrow is the sum of the rates of the regular rotation of the arrow (360\u00b0 every 360\u00b0 rotation = 1) and the rotation of the disk around the clock with twice the circumference (360\u00b0 every 180\u00b0 = 2). Thus, the rotation factor of the arrow is 3, and so our answer corresponds to 360\u00b0/3 = 120\u00b0, which is 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$</p>",
        "<p>The arrow travels a path of radius 30 (20 from the interior clock and 10 from the radius of the disk itself). We note that 1 complete rotation of 360 degrees is needed for the arrow to appear up again, so, therefore, the disk must travel its circumference before the arrow goes up. Its circumference is $20\\pi$, so that is $20\\pi$ traveled on a $60\\pi$ arrow path. This is a ratio of 1/3, so the angle it carves is 120 degrees, which leads us to the correct answer of 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$</p>",

        "<p>We can approach this problem with angle measures.

Since $45^2=2025$, $p_{2024}$ is the bottom right corner of the $45\\times 45$ square. This point is $\\frac{45-1}{2}=22$ over to the right, and therefore $22$ down, so $p_{2024}=(22, -22)$. Since $p_{2024}$ is $9$ ahead of $p_{2015}$, we go back $9$ spaces to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; (13, -22)}$.</p>",
        "<p>We call $p_0$ the first point, $p_1$ the second, and so on. As in Solution 3, we see that he walks in a counterclockwise spiral. We see that his path is traced out by a series of squares with odd-length sides that contain each other. At step $3^2=9,$ he is at $(1,-1)$; at step $5^2=25,$ he is at $(2,-2)$; and so on. We see that at step $n^2$ where $n$ is an odd number, he is at $(x,-x)$ where $x=\\dfrac{n-1}2.$ The closest $n^2$ to $2016$ (we want $p_{2015},$ which is the $2016$th step) is $45^2=2025,$ so we let $n=45.$ On the $45^2=2025$th step, $x=\\dfrac{45-1}2=22,$ so he is at $(22,-22).$ We see that he approached $(22,-22)$ from the left, so backtrack $2025-2016=9$ steps to the left (i.e. subtracting $9$ from the x-coordinate). Thus, we have $(22-9,-22)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~(13,-22).}$ ~Technodoggo</p>",

        "<p>If we graph $p_n$ for a few values of $n$, we begin to see a particular pattern for $p_n$ when $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $p_0=(0,0)$, $p_4=(-1,1)$, $p_{16}=(2,-2)$, and so on. Similarly, $p_1=(1,0)$, $p_9=(2,-1)$, $p_{25}=(3,-2)$, and so on. Using this, we can generate a pattern for even and odd squares: \\[p_{(2n)^2}=(-n, n)\\] \\[p_{(2n+1)^2}=(n+1,-n)\\]</p><p>We notice that $p_{2015}$ is quite close to $p_{2025}=p_{45^2}$. By the same pattern for odd squares, $p_{2025}=(23,-22)$. $p_{2015}$ is just $10$ units to the left of $p_{2025}$.
