The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$.

Meanwhile, the bottom square of each (except the 7x7x7 cube) won't be counted because of the stacking.

Start by squaring $x + y$, to obtain \\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 16\\]Simplifying, $x^2 + y^2 = 20$. Squaring once more, we obtain \\[x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 = 400\\]Once again simplifying, $x^4 + y^4 = 392$.

Using this, we can make the following Newton sums:\\[P_1 = S_1\\]\\[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2\\]\\[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2\\]\\[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2\\]\\[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2.\\]We also know that $S_1$ is 4 because $x + y$ is four, and we know that $S_2$ is $-2$ because $x \\cdot y$ is $-2$ as well.Then, we can plug in values!

Now all we need to find is $x^5 + y^5$. Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 = 4^5 = 1024$. The extra terms that we don't need is $5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 = 5xy(x^3 + y^3) + 10x^2y^2(x + y) = -10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$. What's $x^3 + y^3$? We use the same method. Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy(x + y) = x^3 + y^3 - 24 = 4^3 = 64$. Now we know that $x^3 + y^3 = 64 + 24 = 88$, and plugging that into $-10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$ gives $-10(88) + 160 = -880 + 160 = -720$. Now we see that those extra terms have a sum of $-720$. Thus $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + y^5 - 720 = 1024$ so $x^5 + y^5 = 1024 + 720 = 1744$. Remember our goal: we want to find $\\frac{-8 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$.

        "<p>Since we start at the top face and end at the bottom face without moving from the lower ring to the upper ring or revisiting a face, our journey must consist of the top face, a series of faces in the upper ring, a series of faces in the lower ring, and the bottom face, in that order.</p><p>We have $5$ choices for which face we visit first on the top ring. From there, we have $9$ choices for how far around the top ring we go before moving down: $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around clockwise, $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around counterclockwise, or immediately going down to the lower ring without visiting any other faces in the upper ring.</p><p>We then have $2$ choices for which lower ring face to visit first (since every upper-ring face is adjacent to exactly $2$ lower-ring faces) and then once again $9$ choices for how to travel around the lower ring.

        "<p>There are five ways to get to the top ring. Casework:</p><p>Case 1: directly go to bottom ringFor each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we have two ways of directly going to the bottom ring, as each face on the top is adjacent to two faces on the bottom. There are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ paths here.</p><p>Case 2: traversing sidewaysAfter entering the top ring, we can also choose to travel sideways along the top ring before going to the bottom ring. For each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we can choose 2 directions to go (clockwise or counterclockwise). Once we choose a direction, we can go 1, 2, 3, or 4 faces in that direction. Notice we cannot travel 5 faces because then we would land on the original top ring face, but the problem specifies that we can only travel each face once. Once again, top ring faces are each adjacent to two bottom ring faces, so after traversing sideways we can choose 2 paths to exit. There are $5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 80$ paths here.</p><p>Adding the two cases together, there are 90 ways to get to the bottom ring from the top.</p><p>Next, from the bottom ring to the bottom we do casework again:</p><p>Case 1: directly go to the bottomFor each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there is only 1 way to get to the bottom. So there are 90 ways here.</p><p>Case 2: traversing sidewaysFor each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there are once again 2 ways to choose the direction and 4 ways to choose the amount of faces traveled. However, after traveling the faces there is only 1 way to go to the bottom face. There are $90 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 720$ paths here.</p><p>Adding together the cases, there are 810 paths, or answer choice E.~JH. L</p>",
        "<p>Like Solution 3, we can use casework, but in a different way. We can split the caseworks into the amount of moves we spend on each row (top and bottom, where both rows have 5 faces).</p><p>Case 1: 1 move on the top row;There are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row from the starting point (just moving on each of the five faces). Now we want to look at how many ways we can move towards the bottom. Notice how we have two faces on the bottom row that are adjacent to each of the top faces. If we spend one move on the bottom, there are 2 ways. If we spend two moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways (since order matters, we can flip the direction of these moves). If we spend three moves on the bottom, there are also 4 ways (similar reasoning). If we spend four moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways. And if we spend five moves on the bottom, there are again, 4 ways. In total there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18$ ways to move from the bottom after the top moves are chosen. And since there are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row, there are $5 \\cdot 18 = 90$ ways.</p><p>Case 2: 2 moves on the top row;From just counting, we can see that there are five ways to move once on the top, and after that, two options for the second move (either left or right), so there are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ ways. And from using what we obtained in Case 1, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case.</p><p>Case 3: three moves on the top row;There are, again, 10 ways to do this. And so, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case to happen.</p><p>Now, we can see that there will be 10 ways for the remaining cases of the first move for the top row (because 5 ways to choose the first, and then you can go either left or right, so $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$).So for Case 4 and Case 5, there will both also be $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways.</p><p>Finally, adding all these cases up, we obtain $90 + 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 810$, or $\\boxed{(E)}$~Misclicked</p>"

This implies that $n$ does not divide either $998, 999$ or $1000$, meaning that when divided by $n$, none of the quotients are whole. In turn, this also means that they will all have the same whole number part. </p><p><br/>If $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ were to have a different whole number part, then $n$ would have to lie within $998$ and $1000$. If this is confusing, think of why $\\frac{6}{5}, \\frac{7}{5}$ and $\\frac{8}{5}$ have the same whole number part ($1$ in this case). Here, $n=5$. What happens to the whole number part when $n=7$? </p><p><br/>Since $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ have identical whole number parts, their floors are identical, since the floor of a number is equal to its whole number part, discarding its fractional component. </p><p><br/>Let $k$ be the number we get when we floor $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ or $\\frac{1000}{n}$ if the three of those numbers lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$. Adding them up, we get $3k$ (due to their floors being the same), which is a mulutiple of $3$. So no matter what, we cannot have $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$. </p><p><br/>What does this mean? It means that there must be some multiple of $n$ within this expression (with some restrictions, as we'll see), in order to prevent the violation of the main restriction. We can proceed with casework now.</p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 1}$</p><p><br/>Let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{998}{n}$. Luckily, the only prime factors of $998$ are $2$ and $499$. </p><p><br/>We can observe that $499$ doesn't work, since $\\frac{998}{499}$ and $\\frac{1000}{499}$ will both round down to $2$ when divided by it. However, $2$ does work, since it divides both $998$ and $1000$. The floor of $\\frac{999}{2}$ is $499$, , meaning that when we evaluate the given expression for $n=2$, we will get $2\\cdot{499}+500$ which isn't a multiple of $3$. </p><p><br/>This case works because we have a multiple of $n$ at the end of the expression, as well as the beginning, so the whole number parts of $998, 999$ and $1000$ when divided by $n$ are not all the same, due to $n$ dividing two of these numbers. </p><p>The restriction of $n$ dividing more than one number within the expression is only valid when we're testing the first number in the given expression (otherwise, the other floors wouldn't round down to the same value as the first). </p><p>Case $1$ is complete, and we've found that only $2$ works. </p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 2}$</p><p>Now, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{999}{n}$. In this case, if $n$ divides $999$, it doesn't divide $998$ (since two multiples of a number greater than $1$ are never consecutive), nor does it divide $1000$, for the same reason. </p><p><br/>The prime factorization of $999$ is $3^3\\cdot37$, and thus has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ divisors. </p><p><br/>When testing a few values of $n$ initially, we observed that $n=1$ causes the expression to be divisible by $3$. Subtracting $1$, we see that there are $7$ values of $n$ that work for this case.</p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 3}$</p><p>Finally, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{1000}{n}.$</p><p><br/>Our goal is to have the other multiple of $n$ below whatever $\\frac{998}{n}$ is, so we won't have identical floors throughout the expression. </p><p><br/>Once again, any factor of $1000$, except for $2$ is relatively prime to both $998$ and $999$, so when we floor those two numbers, we get an integer that isn't $500$. </p><p><br/>$1000$ factors as $2^3\\cdot{5^3}$, meaning that it has $(3+1)(3+1)=16$ divisors. $1$ and $2$ either don't work or have already been counted, so there are $14$ valid values of $n$ for this case. </p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Ending}$</p><p><br/>Adding these three cases, we get $1+7+14= \\boxed{\\textbf{A) }22}$ values of $n$.</p><p>-Benedict T (countmath1)</p>",

Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$'s final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.</p><p>Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.</p><p>Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",
        "<p>As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation.</p><p>Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$, $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$, and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$, just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ($0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$. This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways.</p><p>Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$, which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways.</p><p>$6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",
        "<p>Define $s$ as a reflection, and $r$ as a $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation. Thus, $r^4=s^2=e$, and the five transformations can be represented as ${r, r^2, r^3, r^2s, s}$, and $rs=sr^{-1}$.</p><p>Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total.</p><p>For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$, else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$, which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$. A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$). This gives $6$ ways.</p><p>Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$.</p><p>~Xrider100</p>"

Since, $n>1000$, we can do some bounding and get that $k > 53$ and $\\ell > 17$.

It follows that $y$ must be odd, since the GCD will be $120$ instead of $60$ if $y$ is even. Also, the unit digit of $n$ must be $7$, since the unit digit of $60y$ is always $0$ and the unit digit of $57$ is $7$.

        "<p>First, we find $n$. We know that it is greater than $1000$, so we first input $n = 1000$. From the first equation, $\\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$, we know that if $n$ is correct, after we add $120$ to it, it should be divisible by $21$, but not $63$: \\[\\frac{n + 120}{21} = \\frac{1120}{21} = 53\\text{ R }7.\\]This does not work. To get to the nearest number divisible by $21$, we have to add $14$ to cancel out the remainder. (Note that we don't subtract $7$ to get to $53$; $n$ is already at its lowest possible value!)Adding $14$ to $1000$ gives us $n = 1014$.

This requires some guessing and checking. We can add $21$ over and over again until $n$ is valid. This changes $n$ while also maintaining that $\\frac{n + 120}{21}$ has no remainders. After adding $21$ once, we get $18 r 18$. By pure luck, adding $21$ two more times gives us $19$ with no remainders. We now have $1077 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 1140$. However, this number is divisible by $120$. To get the next possible number, we add the LCM of $21$ and $60$ (once again, to maintain divisibility), which is $420$. Unfortunately, $1140 + 420 = 1560$ is still divisible by $120$. Adding $420$ again gives us $1980$, which is valid.

Since in this case, every dice's initial outcome is $4$, $5$ or $6$, this value is $1$, $2$ or $3$. By basic dice probability, the probability that they add to one is $0$; the probability that they add to two is $\\frac{1}{36}$; the probability that they add to three is $\\frac{1}{18}$. Each of these probabilities is less than $\\frac{5}{72}$, (the probability of winning by rerolling everything) so Jason should not reroll one dice in this scenario.

Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$, this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$.</p><p><b>Proof of only-if part</b>: If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$.

        "<p>Suppose that we have a deck, currently containing just one black card. We then insert $n$ red cards one-by-one into the deck at random positions. It is easy to see using induction, that the black card is randomly situated in the deck. </p><p>Now, suppose that we have this deck again, with only one black card. Each time we pick a red ball, we place a card above the black card, and each time we pick a blue ball, we place a card below the black card. It is easy to see that the probability that the card is inserted into the top part of the deck is simply equal to the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, and the probability that the card is inserted into the bottom part of the deck is equal to the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. Therefore, this is equivalent to inserting the card randomly into the deck.</p><p>Finally, four more red cards will be inserted into the deck, and so the black card can be in five possible positions.

        "<p>First, notice that when George chooses a ball he just adds another ball of the same color. On George's first move, he either chooses the red or the blue with a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance each.

Then, he can either choose another Red(chance $\\frac{2}{3}$), in which case he must choose two blues to get three of each, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{1}{10}$ or a blue for two blue and two red in the urn, with chance $\\frac{1}{3}$.

        "<p>A solution pretty similar to the above is as follows.</p><p>Your only two cases of having 3R and 3B after 4 iterations are (without regard to order; if you do order, you multiply by 2 on both the top and the bottom and yield the same result):</p><p>1|1 -> 2|1 -> 3|1 -> 3|2 -> 3|3, and this occurs with probability (1)(2/3)(1/4)(2/5)=1/15.</p><p>1|1 -> 2|1 -> 2|2 -> 3|2 -> 3|3, and this occurs with probability (1)(1/3)(1)(2/5)=2/15.

        "<p>Basically, George is picking a ball and adding another ball of that color to the urn. Basically, he needs to pick a red ball twice and a blue ball twice to get 3 red and 3 blue balls in the urn. The number of ways to choose a red ball twice is $1\\cdot 2$ (at the start there's 1 red ball, then he needs to choose it again when there's 2, and then there is 3 red balls so he doesn't need to choose it again). Similarly the number of ways to choose blue balls twice is 2. $2\\cdot 2$ = 4 ways to choose 2 red balls and 2 blue balls (not considering order). The total number of ways is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$. Adding order to the 4 ways to choose 2 red and 2 blue balls, it is 4C2 because out of the 4 ball choosings, 2 of them must be red, and we automatically make the other ones blue. $\\frac{\\binom42 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{5}$.</p>"

        "<p>Note that $96 = 3 \\cdot 2^5$, and that $D$ of a perfect power of a prime is relatively easy to calculate. Also note that you can find $D(96)$ from $D(32)$ by simply totaling the number of ways there are to insert a $3$ into a set of numbers that multiply to $32$.</p><p>First, calculate $D(32)$. Since $32 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2$, all you have to do was find the number of ways to divide the $2$'s into groups, such that each group has at least one $2$. By stars and bars, this results in $1$ way with five terms, $4$ ways with four terms, $6$ ways with three terms, $4$ ways with two terms, and $1$ way with one term. (The total, $16$, is not needed for the remaining calculations.)</p><p>Then, to get $D(96)$, in each possible $D(32)$ sequence, insert a $3$ somewhere in it, either by placing it somewhere next to the original numbers (in one of $n+1$ ways, where $n$ is the number of terms in the $D(32)$ sequence), or by multiplying one of the numbers by $3$ (in one of $n$ ways). There are $2+1=3$ ways to do this with one term, $3+2=5$ with two, $7$ with three, $9$ with four, and $11$ with five.</p><p>The resulting number of possible sequences is $3 \\cdot 1 + 5 \\cdot 4 + 7 \\cdot 6 + 9 \\cdot 4 + 11 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$. ~<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Emerald_block\" title=\"User:Emerald block\">emerald_block</a></p>",
        "<p>Consider the arrangement of the prime factors of 96 in a line $(2,2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$. An arrangement of factors can be created by placing \"dividers\" to group primes. For example, $(2, 2, |, 2, 2, 2, |, 3)$ is equivalent to the arrangement $4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3$. Because there are $6$ ways to order the prime factors, and $2^5$ ways to place dividers, this gives us an initial $6 \\cdot  2^5$ ways to arrange divisors. </p><p>However, through this method, we overcount cases where $3$ is combined with another factor. For example, the arrangement $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4$ can be written as $(2, 2, |, 2, 3, |, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 2, |, 3, 2, |, 2, 2)$. Precisely, we double count any case with $6$ as a factor, triple count any case with $12$, quadruple count any case with $24$, etc.  </p><p>Now, consider all cases where $3$ must be grouped with at least one $2$. This can be expressed in the same \"line\" format as $(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)$, where dividers can again be placed to group divisors. In this case, there are $5$ ways to order divisors, and $2^4$ ways to place dividers, so we have an $5 \\cdot 2^4$ possible sequences for this case. Notice that in this format, we double count cases where $12$ is a factor, we triple count cases where $24$ is a factor, etc. Precisely, for any case counted $n$ times in the first step, it is counted $n - 1$ times in this step. Thus, if we subtract, we count each case exactly once. </p><p>So, we get:</p><p>$6 \\cdot  2^5 - 5 \\cdot 2^4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$. ~<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Hdai1122\" title=\"User:Hdai1122\">hdai1122</a></p>",
