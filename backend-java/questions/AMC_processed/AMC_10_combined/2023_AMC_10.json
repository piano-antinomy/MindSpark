One can easily see mentally that 5 x 8 that is 40 squared is 1600, and then one has to do just one more computation and see that 5 x 9 that is 45 squared exceeds 2023, so the answer is 8. </p><p>~edit by RobinDaBank</p><p>Note that you can find the square of any number that ends in 5 by taking the number 5 more than it and the number 5 less than it, multiplying those together, and adding 25.

        "<p>Because each bin will have an odd number, they will have at least one ball. So we can put one ball in each bin prematurely. We then can add groups of 2 balls into each bin, meaning we now just have to spread 1010 pairs over 3 bins. This will force every bin to have an odd number of balls. Using stars and bars, we find that this is equal to $\\binom{1012}{2}$. This is equal to $\\frac{1012\\cdot1011}{2}$. The total amount of ways would also be found using stars and bars. That would be $\\binom{2023+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{2025}{2}$. Dividing our two quantities, we get $\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 2025 \\cdot 2024}$. We can roughly cancel $\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011}{2025 \\cdot 2024}$ to get $\\frac{1}{4}$.

        "<p>Suppose the numbers are $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$.

Changing the equation, we see that $\\frac{[(a_1)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_2)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_3)+1]}{2}=\\frac{(2023+3)}{2}$. Let $a_1+1=2b_1$, $a_2+1=2b_2$, and $a_3+1=2b_3$. Thus $b_1+b_2+b_3=1013$. We can also see that $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ are all positive.

Similarly, the area of $\\triangle UFK$ is half that of $\\triangle PFK$. Thus:</p><p><br/>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(5 \\cdot[DKT]-5 \\cdot [PFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK])\\]</p><p>We also know that since we dropped an altitude from $O$ to $U$, the area of $\\triangle ODU$ must be half of a fifth of the total area of the pentagon. Therefore we can rewrite the above equation as \\[[FGHIJ]=10 \\cdot ([ODU]-[DVT]+[UFK])\\]</p><p>Now notice that $\\triangle ODU  ~ \\triangle TDV ~ \\triangle KFU$ by AA similarity. Therefore, if we can write the areas of the latter two triangles as a ratio of the first triangle, we can express the whole equation in terms of $[ODU]$, and by extension $[ABCDE]$, which we know. To find these ratios, we can find the side length ratios and square them because the triangles are similar.</p><p>We already know $DU = \\frac{s}{2}$, so let's try to find it's analogous side for $\\triangle TDV$ and $\\triangle KFU$. These sides are $DV$ and $FU$, respectively. </p><p>First, $\\frac{s}{2} = OD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})$, so $OD = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})$. Then notice that $DV = \\frac{OD}{2}$ because we have to fold $D$ to hit $O$, so the folding crease has to be exactly halfway between $O$ and $D$. Therefore, \\[DV = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{DU}{DV} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})} = 2 \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})\\]</p><p>Now the ratio between the area of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their analogous side lengths. Thus\\[\\frac{[ODU]}{[TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{10 \\cdot [ODU]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\]\\[\\implies \\frac{[ABCDE]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\]\\[\\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})} \\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})\\]</p><p>Now let's move on and calculate the ratio of the other side length. Calculating $FU$ is slightly tricker. First, we find $TD$: $TD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ}) = DV = \\frac{s}{4} sec^54^{\\circ}) \\implies TD = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})$. Now since $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles, $TD = DK$ and $UK = DK-DU = TD-DU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})-\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (sec^2(54^{\\circ})-2) = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1)$.</p><p>Now $FU = UK \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ}) \\implies FU \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1) \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ})$. Now note that $tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x) = 1$ because opposite over adjacent cancel each other out in a right triangle. Thus, $FU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))$</p><p>Now, \\[\\frac{DU}{FU} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))} = \\frac{2}{tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ})}\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies \\frac{[DU]}{[FU]} = \\frac{4}{(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2} \\implies 10 \\cdot [FU] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>Now we go back to our first equation and plug in our values:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = 1+\\sqrt{5}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})+\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (4-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2)\\]</p><p>Note $(tan(x)-tan(90-x))^2 = tan^2(x)-2 \\cdot tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x)+tan^2(90-x) = tan^2(x)-2+tan^2(90-x)$.</p><p>Also note that $tan^2(x)+1 = sec^2(x)$.Thus \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2+(-1)+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) \\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\].</p><p>Now all that remains is to find $tan^2(36^{\\circ})$. We can use the tan addition formula to find the general form of $tan(5x)$ or remember question 25 from this year's AMC 12A. We have that \\[tan(5x) = \\frac{5tan(x)-10tan^3(x)+tan^5(x)}{1-10tan^2(x)+5tan^4(x)}\\]. </p><p>Plug in $x=36$. Then we have \\[tan(180^{\\circ}) = \\frac{5tan(36^{\\circ})-10tan^3(36^{\\circ})+tan^5(36^{\\circ})}{1-10tan^2(36^{\\circ})+5tan^4(36^{\\circ})}\\]Now let $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$. We have the equation \\[\\frac{5y-10y^3+y^5}{1-10y^2+5y^4} = 0 \\implies 5y-10y^3+y^5 = 0\\]\\[\\implies 5-10y^2+y^4 = 0 \\implies 5-10z+z^2 = 0\\]Where we let $z = y^2$. Using the quadratic formula, we have \\[z = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\\]Now since $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$, $z = tan^2(36^{\\circ})$, which is what we were looking for. Notice that $tan(0^{\\circ}) = 0$ and $tan(45^{\\circ}) = 1$, so $tan(36^{\\circ})$ is between $0$ and $1$, and so is it's square. Thus $z = 5 - 2\\sqrt{5}$, not the other root.</p><p>Finally:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+5-2\\sqrt{5})\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (6-2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}-4}{4} = \\sqrt{5}-1\\]</p><p>Therefore, \\[[FGHIJ] = \\sqrt{5}-1 = \\boxed{B}\\]</p><p><br/>~KingRavi</p>",
