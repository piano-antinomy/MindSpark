From the formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression (or arithmetic series), we have $12*\\frac{a_1+a_{12}}{2}=360$, which leads us to $a_1 + a_{12} = 60$. $a_{12}$, the largest term of the progression, can also be expressed as $a_1+11d$, where $d$ is the common difference. Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$. Since $d$ is an integer, the difference between the first and last terms, $11d$, must be divisible by $11.$ Since the total difference must be less than $60$, we can start checking multiples of $11$ less than $60$ for the total difference between $a_1$ and $a_{12}$. We start with the largest multiple, because the maximum difference will result in the minimum value of the first term. If the difference is $55$, $a_1=\\frac{60-55}{2}=2.5$, which is not an integer, nor is it one of the five options given.

        "<p>First, there is only one way for the middle square to be black because it is not affected by the rotation. Then we can consider the corners and edges separately. Let's first just consider the number of ways we can color the corners. There is $1$ case with all-black squares. There are four cases with one white square and all $4$ work. There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares. Then the total number of ways to color the corners is $1+4+2=7$. In essence, the edges work the same way, so there are also $7$ ways to color them.

Thus, there are $8$ cases.<br/>Case 3: 2 white squares. We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this.<br/>Case 4: 3 white squares.Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case.<br/>Case 5: 4 white squares.Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4.Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions.

In the general $k$-dimensional case, we are asked to find the probability that a randomly chosen $k$-tuple $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k}) \\in [0,n]^{k}$ satisfies $|x_{i} - x_{j}| > 1$ for all $i \\ne j$. To avoid repetition, let us say that $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is <i>spaced-out</i> if $|x_{i} - x_{j}| > 1$ for all $i \\ne j$.</p><p>Let $C$ be the $k$-dimensional hyper-cube of side length $n$: \\[C = [0,n]^{k} = \\big\\{(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k} \\;:\\; 0 \\leqslant x_{i} \\leqslant n \\text{ for all }i \\big\\} \\;.\\] Then $C$ has volume $n^{k}$. Let $S$ be the set of spaced-out $k$-tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$. The desired probability is Vol$(S)/n^{k}$. </p><p>The set of $k$-tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ such that there exist distinct indices $i, j$ such that $x_{i} = x_{j}$ has volume $0$, so we may restrict our attention to $k$-tuples such that $x_{i} \\ne x_{j}$ for all $i \\ne j$. </p><p>Further, the condition that $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is spaced-out is \"invariant upon permuting the indices\"; in other words, if $\\sigma$ is a permutation of the set of indices $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$, then $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is spaced-out if and only if $(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\dotsc,x_{\\sigma(k)})$ is spaced-out. Therefore, we may consider the set of spaced-out $k$-tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ which additionally satisfy $x_{1} < \\dotsb < x_{k}$. Let us denote this set by $T$. This condition is equivalent to \\[0 \\leqslant x_{1} < x_{2} - 1 < \\dotsb < x_{i}-(i-1) < \\dotsb < x_{k}-(k-1) \\leqslant n-(k-1) \\;.\\]Let us choose new variables $y_{i} = x_{i} - (i-1)$ for $i = 1,\\dotsc,k$. This change of variables is just a translation of each $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ by the vector $(0,1,\\dots,k-1)$; in the above solutions, it corresponds to taking the 6 tetrahedrons and gluing them together to form a cube. </p><p>We now compute the volume of the set of $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k}) \\in [0,n-(k-1)]^{k}$ which satisfy $y_{1} < \\dotsb < y_{k}$. As above, we can disregard any $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k})$ such that $y_{i} = y_{j}$ for some $i \\ne j$. Given any $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k})$ such that $y_{i} \\ne y_{j}$ for all $i \\ne j$, there exists exactly one permutation $\\sigma$ of the indices $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$ such that $y_{\\sigma(1)} < \\dotsb < y_{\\sigma(k)}$. Since there are $k!$ permutations of $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$, the desired volume is equal to $\\frac{1}{k!}$ times the volume of the $k$-dimensional hyper-cube of side length $n-(k-1)$, which is $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$. Hence $T$ has volume $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$ as well and $S$ has volume $(n-(k-1))^{k}$. Hence the desired probability is $\\frac{(n-(k-1))^{k}}{n^{k}}$.</p>",

We are just trying to find the probability that those three \"blocks\" do not overlap. To do this we can set each unit of $1$ into $\\mu$ equal little increments, and take the limit of the probability as $\\mu$ approaches $\\infty$. (This is because there are indefinitely many real numbers in a given interval.) We see that the total number of arrangements for the three blocks of $1$, without considering the rule that no two blocks shall overlap is $(n\\mu + 1)^3$/3!. We see that the number of ways to arrange the three blocks such that no three of them are overlapping is simply $\\dbinom{(n-2)\\mu + 3}{3}$.

We know the coordinates of all of the points in $BFDG$ except $F$. Since $F$ is the intersection of $\\overline{ED}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, we can use a system of equations to solve for the coordinates of $F$. The line for $\\overline{BC}$ is simply $x = 6$. The line for $\\overline{ED}$ passes through the origin so it has a y-intercept of $0$, and a slope of $\\frac{30-0}{8-0}=\\frac{30}{8}=\\frac{15}{4}$. Therefore, the line for $\\overline{ED}$ is $y=\\frac{15}{4} x$. Substituting $6$ for $x$, we find that $y = \\frac{45}{2}$. Therefore, $F=(6, \\frac{45}{2})$. Applying Shoelace on these points gives us that $[BFDG] = \\boxed{\\frac{135}{2}}$.</p>"

Then because there is at least one song liked by each pair of girls, we require either $b$ or $c$ to be at least 1. In fact, we require either $b$ or $c$ to equal 1, otherwise there will be a song liked by all three. Suppose $b = 1$.
