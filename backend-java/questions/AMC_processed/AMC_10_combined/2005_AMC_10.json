        "<p>For the statement to be true, we must have both $n$ and $n + 48$ be squares of primes. Support we have the number $x^2$, where $x$ is a positive integer. Then the next perfect square, $(x+1)^2$, is $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 2x+1$ greater than $x^2$. The next perfect square after that will be $(x+2)^2 = 4x + 4$ greater than $x^2$. In general, the prime $(x+n)^2$ will be $nx + n^2$ greater than $x^2$. However, we must have that $nx + n^2 = 48$. $n$ can take on any value between $1$ and $6$ (if $n$ is equal to $7$, we have $14x + 49$, where $x$ would have to be negative for the difference to be $48$). However, we can eliminate all the cases where $n$ is odd, because we would then have a number of the form $even + odd$, which is odd because $x$ can take only integral values. As such, we consider $n = 2$, $n = 4$, and $n = 6$. If $n = 2$, then $4x + 4 = 48 \\implies x = 11$. Then our squares are $11^2$ and $13^2$, both of which are squares of primes. If $n = 4$, then $8x + 16 = 48 \\implies x = 4$. However, $4$ isn't prime, so we discard this case. Finally, if $n = 6$, then $12x + 36 = 48 \\implies x = 1$. Again, $1$ isn't prime, so we discard this case as well.

        "<p>We know that since it asks for $\\sqrt{n}$, we know that $n$ must be a perfect square. Plus, we need $n$ to be a perfect square of a prime since otherwise $P(n)$ won't be equal to the $\\sqrt{n}$. We can apply the same logic to $\\sqrt{n+48}$, and since we also the difference between two consecutive squares is an odd number, we must have an even number of consecutive odd numbers to sum up to $48$ since it is even. Thus, this leads us to three cases, since if we split 48 into even more consecutive odd numbers we will go into the negatives:</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 23 + 25$</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15$</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13$</p><p>We know that an odd number, $n$, is equal to the difference of squares between $n/2 - 0.5$ and $n/2 + 0.5$. This means we can test these cases and find $n$ using the least odd number in each case. By looking at the first one, we see that $23/2 - 0.5 = 11$, and squaring it into $121$ and setting it to $n$, we realize this works for the first part where $P(n)$ is equal to the $\\sqrt{n}$. Now, if we add $48$ we get $169$, which works for the second part. If we do this for the second case, $9/2 - 0.5 = 4$, and square it and set it as $n$, we realize that since $\\sqrt{n}$ must be prime and $4$ is composite, so this can't work. Finally for the last case, we do $3/2 - 0.5 = 1$, and since $1^2 = 1$, this case doesn't work since $n$ must be greater than $1$. Thus, our only valid case is the first one and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}~1}$.</p><p>~ neeyakkid23</p>"

        "<p>By setting the area of $ABEF$ equal to $2$ times the area of $DCEF$, you get that $AB + FE = 2(DC + FE)$. Thus, $AB = 2DC + FE$. Note that $FE = DC + \\frac{AB-DC}{2}$.

        "<p>Let $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$. The given conditions imply $x>y$, which implies $a>b$, and they also imply that both $a$ and $b$ are nonzero. </p><p>Then, $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (9a - 9b)(11a + 11b) = 99(a-b)(a+b) = m^2$. </p><p>Since this must be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. $99$ factorizes into $3^2 \\cdot 11$, so $11|(a-b)(a+b)$. However, the maximum value of $a-b$ is $9-1=8$, so $11|a+b$. The maximum value of $a+b$ is $9+8=17$, so $a+b=11$. </p><p>Then, we have $33^2(a-b) = m^2$, so $a-b$ is a perfect square, but the only perfect squares that are within our bound on $a-b$ are $1$ and $4$. We know $a+b=11$, and, for $a-b=1$, adding equations to eliminate $b$ gives us $2a=12 \\Longrightarrow a=6, b=5$. Testing $a-b=4$ gives us $2a=15 \\Longrightarrow a=\\frac{15}{2}, b=\\frac{7}{2}$, which is impossible, as $a$ and $b$ must be digits. Therefore, $(a,b) = (6,5)$, and $x+y+m=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.</p>",
        "<p>The first steps are the same as Solution 1. Let $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$, where we know that a and b are digits (whole numbers less than $10$). </p><p>Like Solution 1, we end up getting $(9a - 9b)(11a + 11b) = 99(a-b)(a+b) = m^2$. This is where the solution diverges. </p><p>We know that the left side of the equation is a perfect square because $m$ is an integer. If we factor $99$ into its prime factors, we get $3^2\\cdot 11$. In order to get a perfect square on the left side, $(a-b)(a+b)$ must make both prime exponents even. Because the a and b are digits, a simple guess would be that $(a+b)$ (the bigger number) equals $11$ while $(a-b)$ is a factor of nine (1 or 9). The correct guesses are $a = 6, b = 5$ causing $x = 65, y = 56,$ and $m = 33$. The sum of the numbers is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$</p>",
        "<p>Once again, the solution is quite similar as the above solutions. Since $x$ and $y$ are two digit integers, we can write $x = 10a+b, y = 10b+a$ and because $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$, substituting and factoring, we get $99(a+b)(a-b) = m^2$. </p><p>Therefore, $(a+b)(a-b) = \\frac{m^2}{99}$ and $\\frac{m^2}{99}$ must be an integer. A quick strategy is to find the smallest such integer $m$ such that $\\frac{m^2}{99}$ is an integer. We notice that 99 has a prime factorization of $3^2 \\cdot 11.$</p><p>Let $m^2 = n.$ Since we need a perfect square and 3 is already squared, we just need to square 11. So $3^2 \\cdot 11^2$ gives us 1089 as $n$ and $m = \\sqrt{1089} = 33.$ We now get the equation $(x-y)(x+y) = 33^2$, which we can also write as   $(x-y)(x+y) = 11^2 \\cdot 3^2$.</p><p>A very simple guess assumes that $x-y=3^2$ and $x+y=11^2$ since $x$ and $y$ are positive. Finally, we come to the conclusion that $x=65$ and $y=56$, so $x+y+m$ $=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.</p><p>Note that all of the solutions used $a+b$ or $a-b$ as part of their solution.</p>",
        "<p>Continue the same as Solution $3$ until we get $33$. Knowing that $33^2 = 1089$, we have narrowed down our Pythagorean triples. We know that the $2$ other squares should be larger than $33^2$, so we can start testing. </p><p>If we start testing the $40$s, it is fruitless since the closest to $33^2$ would be $33 - 45 - 54$ which is not a Pythagorean triple. We can start by testing out the $50$s, and it turns our that $33 - 56 - 65$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, our answer is $33+56+65$ = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }154}$.</p><p>~Arcticturn</p>"

        "<p>The question asks for the maximum possible number of elements. The integers from $1$ to $24$ can be included because you cannot make $125$ with integers from $1$ to $24$ without the other number being greater than $100$. The integers from $25$ to $100$ are left. They can be paired so the sum is $125$: $25+100$, $26+99$, $27+98$, $\\ldots$, $62+63$. That is $38$ pairs, and at most one number from each pair can be included in the set.

As $62+63$ gives $125$, the numbers $25$ to $62$ can be put in subset $B$ without having two numbers add up to $125$. In this way, subset $B$ will have the numbers $1$ to $62$, and so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 62}$.</p><p>Since there are $38$ numbers that sum to $125$, there are $100-38=62$ numbers not summing to $125.$~mathboy282</p>",

        "<p>We can put all odd numbers into subset B, or we can put all even numbers into subset B, so now there are 50 numbers in the set. I will use all even numbers in this solution. Now, we need to add other odd(or even!) numbers possible in this subset, which is all odd(or even) numbers that can be added so that the sum with 100(or 99) plus the biggest possible odd number(or even) to get 123. This will get us the numbers 1,3,5...21,23(or numbers 2,4,6...22,24), which gives us 12 more numbers, and adding that to the 50 original numbers, we get $B =\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 62}$.</p>"
