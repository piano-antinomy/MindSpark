This means that the sum of the digits decreases by $8$ in total, and we have $-8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$, so the \"mod 9\" of the sum increases by $1$. This means that, regardless of whether the sum carries or not, the modulo 9 of the sum of the digits always increases by $1$.</p><p>Case 1.2.

Clearly, no integers of this form will satisfy the condition because $2007$ is a perfect multiple of $9$.</p><p>Case 2. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>In this case, we apply exactly the same argument. There is at most one carry, which means that the sum of the digits will always be congruent to $2$ mod $9$. Then we can apply similar arguments to get $S(n) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$ and $S(S(n)) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$, so adding gives $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>It is trivial to see that for $n \\equiv k \\pmod 9$, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 8$, we must have $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3k \\pmod 9$. Only when $k=0, 3, 6$ is $3k$ a multiple of $9$, which means that $n$ must be a multiple of $3$.</p><p>Now, we find the integers. Again, consider two cases: Integers that are direct multiples of $9$ and integers that are multiples of $3$ but not $9$.</p><p>Case 1. $n$ is a multiple of $9$. An integer of the form $\\overline{20ab}$ will not work since the least such integer is $2007$ which already exceeds our bounds. Thus, we need only consider the integers of the form $\\overline{19ab}$. The valid sums of the digits of $n$ are $18$ and $27$ in this case.</p><p>Case 1.1. The sum of the digits is $18$. This means that $S(n)=18, S(S(n))=9$, so $n=2007-18-9=1980$. Clearly this number satisfies our constraints.</p><p>Case 1.2. The sum of the digits is $27$. This means that $S(n)=27, S(S(n))=9$, ,so $n=2007-27-9=1971$. Since the sum of the digits of $1971$ is not $27$, this does not work.</p><p>This means that there is $1$ integer in this case.</p><p>Case 2. $n$ is a multiple of $3$, not $9$..Case 2.1. Integers of the form $\\overline{20ab}$. Then $S(n)=3$ or $S(n)=6$; it is trivial to see that $S(n)=6$ exceeds our bounds, so $S(n)=3$ and $n=2007-6=2001$.</p><p>Case 2.2. Integers of the form $\\overline{19ab}$. Then $S(n)=12, 15, 21, 24$ and we consider each case separately.</p><p>Case 2.2.1. Integers with $S(n)=12$. That means $n=2007-12-3=1992$ which clearly does not work.</p><p>Case 2.2.2. Integers with $S(n)=15$. That means $n=2007-15-6=1986$ which also does not work</p><p>Case 2.2.3. Integers with $S(n)=21$. That means $n=2007-21-3=1983$ which is valid.</p><p>Case 2.2.4. Integers with $S(n)=24$. That means $n=2007-24-6=1977$ which is also valid.</p><p>We have considered every case, so there are $\\boxed{4}$ integers that satisfy the given condition.</p><p>~Refined by HamstPan38825</p>",
        "<p>Let the number of digits of $n$ be $m$. If $m = 5$, $n$ will already be greater than $2007$. Notice that $S(n)$ is always at most $9m$. Then if $m = 3$, $n$ will be at most $999$, $S(n)$ will be at most $27$, and $S(S(n))$ will be even smaller than $27$. Clearly we cannot reach a sum of $2007$, unless $m = 4$ (i.e. $n$ has $4$ digits).</p><p>Then, let $n$ be a four digit number in the form $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$. Then $S(n) = a + b + c + d$.</p><p>$S(S(n))$ is the sum of the digits of $a + b + c + d$. We can represent $S(S(n))$ as the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of $S(n)$. The tens digit in the form of a decimal is</p><p><br/>$\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}$.</p><p><br/>To remove the decimal portion, we can simply take the floor of the expression,</p><p><br/>$\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Now that we have expressed the tens digit, we can express the ones digit as $S(n) -10$ times the above expression, or</p><p><br/>$a + b + c + d - 10\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Adding the two expressions yields the value of $S(S(n))$</p><p><br/>$= a + b + c + d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Combining this expression to the ones for $n$ and $S(n)$ yields</p><p><br/>$1002a + 102b + 12c + 3d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Setting this equal to $2007$ and rearranging a bit yields</p><p><br/>$12c + 3d = 2007 - 1002a - 102b + 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c + d = 669 - 334a - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>(The reason for this slightly weird arrangement will soon become evident)</p><p><br/>Now we examine the possible values of $a$. If $a \\ge 3$, $n$ is already too large. $a$ must also be greater than $0$, or $n$ would be a $3$-digit number. Therefore, $a = 1 \\, \\text{or} \\, 2$. Now we examine by case.</p><p>If $a = 2$, then $b$ and $c$ must both be $0$ (otherwise $n$ would already be greater than $2007$). Substituting these values into the equation yields</p><p><br/>$d = 1 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{2 + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $d=1$.</p><p><br/>Sure enough, $2001 + (2+1) + 3=2007$.</p><p>Now we move onto the case where $a = 1$. Then our initial equation simplifies to</p><p><br/>$4c + d = 335 - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{1 + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p><br/>Since $c$ and $d$ can each be at most $9$, we substitute that value to find the lower bound of $b$. Doing so yields</p><p><br/>$34b \\ge 290 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{19 + b}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>The floor expression is at least $3\\lfloor\\frac{19}{10}\\rfloor=3$ , so the right-hand side is at least $293$. Solving for $b$, we see that $b \\ge 9$ $\\Rightarrow$ $b=9$. Again, we substitute for $b$ and the equation becomes</p><p><br/>$4c + d = 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{10 + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c + d = 32 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Just like we did for $b$, we can find the lower bound of $c$ by assuming $d = 9$ and solving:</p><p><br/>$4c + 9 \\ge 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c \\ge 20 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p><br/>The right hand side is $20$ for $c=0$ and $23$ for $c \\ge 1$. Solving for c yields $c \\ge 6$. Looking back at the previous equation, the floor expression is $0$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $3$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. Thus, the right-hand side is $32$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $35$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. We can solve these two scenarios as systems of equations/inequalities:</p><p>$4c+d = 32$</p><p>$c+d \\le 9$</p><p>and</p><p>$4c+d=35$</p><p>$c+d \\ge 10$</p><p>Solving yields three pairs $(c, d):$ $(8, 0)$; $(8, 3)$; and $(7, 7)$. Checking the numbers $1980$, $1983$, and $1977$; we find that all three work. Therefore there are a total of $4$ possibilities for $n$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.</p><p>Note: Although this solution takes a while to read (as well as to write) the actual time it takes to think through the process above is very short in comparison to the solution length.</p><p>~edits by vadava_lx</p>"

        "<p>The ratio of the surface area of the smaller pyramid to the surface area of the larger pyramid is the same as the ratio of the area of the square face of the smaller pyramid to that of the larger pyramid. We take the cross-section through the apex of the larger pyramid, revealing a triangle with a line segment parallel to its base passing through it. Suppose the triangle has height $h$ (the original pyramid has altitude $h$) and base $s$ (the original pyramid's square base has side length $s$). Suppose further that the length of the line segment going through the triangle is $s_2$ (the smaller pyramid's square base has side length $s_2$). By similar triangles, we have the ratio $\\frac{s}{h} = \\frac{s_2}{h-2} \\implies  s_2 = \\frac{s(h-2)}{h}$. Then we have $s_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2 \\implies (\\frac{s(h-2)}{h})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2 \\implies (h-2)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}h^2$. Solving this equation, we get the solutions $h = 4 + 2\\sqrt{2}$ and $h = 4 - 2\\sqrt{2}$. However, with the second solution, the smaller pyramid would have a height that is two less than this, which would result in a negative number ($2 - 2\\sqrt{2}$).
