        "<p>WLOG, let the side length of $ABCD$ be 1. Let $DE = x$. It suffices that $AE = 1 - x$. Then triangles $ABE$ and $CBF$ are congruent by HL, so $CF = AE$ and $DE = DF$. We find that $BE = EF = x \\sqrt{2}$, and so, by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have$(1 - x)^2 + 1 = 2x^2.$ This yields $x^2 + 2x = 2$, so $x^2 = 2 - 2x$. Thus, the desired ratio of areas is\\[\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x^2}{2}}{\\dfrac{1-x}{2}} = \\dfrac{x^2}{1 - x} = \\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}.\\]</p>",
        "<p>Assume $AB=1$. Then, $FC$ is $x$ and $ED$ is $1-x$. We see that using $HL$, $FCB$ is congruent to EAB. Using Pythagoras of triangles $FCB$ and $FDE$ we get $2{(1-x)}^2=x^2+1$. Expanding, we get $2x^2-4x+2=x^2+1$. Simplifying gives $x^2-4x+1=0$ solving using completing the square (or other methods) gives 2 answers: $2-\\sqrt{3}$ and $2+\\sqrt{3}$. Because $x < 1$, $x=2-\\sqrt{3}$. Using the areas, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}$</p>",
        "<p>First, since $\\bigtriangleup BEF$ is equilateral and $ABCD$ is a square, by the Hypothenuse Leg Theorem, $\\bigtriangleup ABE$ is congruent to $\\bigtriangleup CBF$. Then, assume length $AB = BC = x$ and length $DE = DF = y$, then $AE = FC = x - y$. $\\bigtriangleup BEF$ is equilateral, so $EF = EB$ and $EB^2 = EF^2$, it is given that $ABCD$ is a square and $\\bigtriangleup DEF$ and $\\bigtriangleup ABE$ are right triangles. Then we use the Pythagorean theorem to prove that $AB^2 + AE^2 = EB^2$ and since we know that $EB^2 = EF^2$ and $EF^2 = DE^2 + DF^2$, which means $AB^2 + AE^2 = DE^2 + DF^2$. Now we plug in the variables and the equation becomes $x^2 + (x-y)^2 = 2y^2$, expand and simplify and you get $2x^2 - 2xy = y^2$. We want the ratio of area of $\\bigtriangleup DEF$ to $\\bigtriangleup ABE$. Expressed in our variables, the ratio of the area is $\\frac{y^2}{x^2 - xy}$ and we know $2x^2 - 2xy = y^2$, so the ratio must be $2$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}$</p>"

        "<p>Like Solution 1, this is a right triangle, so use a coordinate system and put the right angle at $(0,0)$ and the other two vertices at $(12,0)$ and $(0,5)$. Call point A $(0,5)$, B $(0,0)$ , and C $(12,0)$. Then you need to find the center of the circumscribed and inscribed circles, or circumcenter and incenter of the triangle. Find the center of the circumcenter using the other methods above, which will be at $(6,2.5)$. In order to find the incenter, you will use the fact that it is the point where the three bisectors of the interior angles of the triangle intersect. From point B, the bisector is 45 degrees, so the slope is $y=x$. From point A, draw the angle bisector through the line $(0,0)$ and $(12,0)$ and call it point D. Now you need to find $BD$. Replacing $BD$ with $x$ and $DC$ with $y$ and using the angle bisector theorem $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{13}$, so $y=\\frac{13}{5}x$.

        "<p>Notice that answer choices (C), (D), and (E) are exactly $\\pi$ more than answer choices (A), (B). This suggests that answer choices (C), (D), and (E) are meant to trick you into forgetting to subtract the circle with radius $1$ (area $\\pi$) From this, (A) or (B) are probably the answer choices (since you do need to subtract $\\pi$ at the end!) Since the angle measures of the sectors are $120^{\\circ},$ and we are working with the areas of some equilateral triangles, it only makes sense for the answer to have a $\\sqrt 3$ and not a $\\sqrt 2$ in them (There's no $45^{\\circ}$ angle either). So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)\\ } \\frac 53 \\pi - 2\\sqrt 3 }$.</p><p>~lpieleanu (minor editing and extra details)</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajApE9bdUJQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajApE9bdUJQ</a></p>"
