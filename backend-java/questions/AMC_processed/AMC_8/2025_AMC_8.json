The property that angles $\\angle$$B$ and $\\angle$$C$ measure $60^\\circ$ is significant here, forming $30-60-90$ triangles ($\\triangle$$ABE$ and $\\triangle$$DCF$). Now the assumed larger $^a$ side $BC$ is separated into 3 sections by the 3 shapes. Or $BC = BE + EF + CF$. $^b$ Recall that $\\triangle$$ABE$ and $\\triangle$$DCF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles, the side length ratios are $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Naming the length of the shorter side of the right triangles as $a$, and the length of side $AD$ as $b$, then the trapezoid's side lengths can be expressed in only 2 variables. Now knowing $AD = b$, $DC = 2a$ $^c$, $BC = a + b + a = 2a + b$, and $AC = 2a$, the perimeter is $b + 2a + 2a + b + 2a = 2b + 6a = 30$.
