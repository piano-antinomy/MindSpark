Alice reads a page in 20 seconds, Bob reads a page in 45 seconds and Chandra reads a page in 30 seconds. </p><p>Before Chandra and Bob start reading, Alice says she would like to team read with them.

        "<p>The amount of pages Bob, Chandra, and Alice will read is in the ratio 4:6:9. Therefore, Bob, Chandra, and Alice read 160, 240, and 360 pages respectively. They would also be reading for the same amount of time because the ratio of the pages read was based on the time it takes each of them to read a page.

        "<p>We can solve this using equations. Let Bob read $x$ pages and Chandra read $y$ pages. Then Alice would read $760-x-y$ pages. Then we can set up the equations using the time it takes them to read a page: $45x=30y=20(760-x-y)$. Since we only have two variables, we only need two equations. Let's use $45x=30y$ and $45x=20(760-x-y)$. We can simplify $45x=30y$ down to $3x=2y$ and $45x=20(760-x-y)$ down to $9x=4(760-x-y)$. We can then solve the equations accordingly: </p><p>\\[9x=3040-4x-4y\\]\\[13x=3040-4y\\]</p><p>From the equation $3x=2y$, we know that $4y=6x$.</p><p>\\[13x=3040-6x\\]\\[19x=3040\\]\\[x=160\\]</p><p>Now that we know $x$, we can multiply it by $45$ (Bob's speed) to get the answer: $160\\times45$=$\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 7200}$</p><p>~Trex226</p>"
