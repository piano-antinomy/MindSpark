We can also notice that point $X$ to point $E$ *ALMOST* makes the octagon half shaded. Since we know an octagon has 8 sides, $X$ is one-half of $\\overline{AB}$ which means instead of counting in eights, we need to count in sixteenths. Now back to the problem. Let's say that the midpoint of $\\overline{EF}$ is $Y$, then $\\overline{XY}$ cuts the octagon perfectly in half, but since there is no $Y$, we are now $\\frac1{16}$ away from one-half. We know that $\\frac1{2}=\\frac8{16}$, so we can just do $\\frac8{16}-\\frac1{16}$ which gets us, for the final answer, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~\\frac{7}{16}}$.</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Am24\" rel=\"nofollow\">AM24</a></p>"

Chip $2$ can only multiply with 1 chip. $2+2+1=5$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.</p>",

Since there are 2 ways out of 3 to pick an even chip from a box, the probability of picking an even chip from a box is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Since there are $2$ boxes, we can find that the answer is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}$=$\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{5}{9}}$.</p><p>~JQTX941016</p>"

Now that we know $b$ and $c$, we know that $a=7$, meaning the number of $1$ dollar socks Ralph bought is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 7}$.</p>",
        "<p>If Ralph bought one sock of each kind, he already used $$8$, so there are $$16$ left and 9 socks. If we split the $$16$ into four $$4$ sections, (as it is the smallest possible number that 1, 3, 4, can make in different ways that in all use at least each of the numbers once,) if Ralph bought a $$3$ pair, he would need to buy a $$1$ pair in order for it to add up to a multiple of four. Similarly, if Ralph bought a $$1$ pair, he would either need to buy three $$1$ pairs or a $$3$ pair. If Ralph bought a $$4$ pair, it would already make a group. Now, the problem is just how we can split 9 into 4 groups of 1, 2, or 4. We clearly see that $1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9$, or a $$4$ pair, two $$3$ pairs, and six $$1$ pairs. Because we subtracted the necessary one of each kind, there are two $$4$ pairs, three $$3$ pairs, and seven $$1$ pairs.

        "<p>To simplify the problem, we can reduce the price of each sock by $$1$, resulting in the prices being $$0$, $$2$ and $$3$. This means the total price Ralph spends becomes $$24-12\\times$1=$12$. Now the $$0$ socks aren't worth anything, but we still need to keep in mind there are at least one of them, so the question becomes: at most 11 of $$2$ and $$3$ socks add up to $$12$. It is obvious that $3\\times$2+2\\times$3=$12$, so the number of $$0$ socks (actually $$1$ socks) is $12-3-2=7$.</p><p>Note: this is very similar to Solution 1, but a non algebraic way of thinking about it.</p><p>-bbidev</p>"

        "<p>We can draw a diagram as shown:[asy] size(75); draw((0,0)--(0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0)--cycle); filldraw((0,4)--(1,4)--(1,5)--(0,5)--cycle, gray); filldraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle, gray); filldraw((4,0)--(4,1)--(5,1)--(5,0)--cycle, gray); filldraw((4,4)--(4,5)--(5,5)--(5,4)--cycle, gray); path arc = arc((2.5,4),1.5,0,90); pair P = intersectionpoint(arc,(0,5)--(5,5)); pair Pp=rotate(90,(2.5,2.5))*P, Ppp = rotate(90,(2.5,2.5))*Pp, Pppp=rotate(90,(2.5,2.5))*Ppp; draw(P--Pp--Ppp--Pppp--cycle); [/asy] Let us focus on the $4$ big triangles that, together with the inscribed square, fill in the large square. If we zoom in on one of the four triangles, we can see that it is composed of a small unit square in the corner of the large square and two triangles, one smaller than the other. We are going to focus specifically on the smaller of the two triangles. This triangle is similar to the big triangle itself by $\\mathrm{AA}$ similarity (because the two sides of a square are parallel. To prove this fact, draw a diagonal of the square and find congruent triangles). Let the shorter leg of the big triangle be $x$; then $\\dfrac{x}{x-1}=\\dfrac{5-x}{1}$.\\[x=-x^2+6x-5\\]\\[x^2-5x+5=0\\]\\[x=\\dfrac{5\\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2-(4)(1)(5)}}{2}\\]\\[x=\\dfrac{5\\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]Thus, $x=\\dfrac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, because by symmetry, $x < \\dfrac52$. Note that the other solution we got, namely, $x=\\dfrac{5+\\sqrt 5} 2$, is the length of the segment $5-x$. $x$ and $5-x$ together sum to $5$, the side of the length of the large square, and similarly, the sum of the solutions is $5$. This solution is a result of the symmetry of the problem; if we had set the longer leg of the big triangle to be $x$, then we would solve the same quadratic to find the same roots, the only difference being that we take the other root.</p><p>This means the area of each triangle is $\\dfrac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}*(5-\\dfrac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2})*\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{5}{2}$.Thus, the area of the square is $25-(4*\\dfrac{5}{2})=15\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$.</p><p>Don't use this in a contest scenario, and only use it when practicing math skills.\u00a0:)</p><p><br/></p>",

The area of this square is composed of the center white square and the four red triangles. Because the inner square has an area of $(5-2)$, $3$, squared, $9$, it also has a length of $\\sqrt{9}=3$. The heights of each of the red triangles are 1 (because the gray squares have lengths of one), and the area of one triangle is namely $\\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{2}$. Thus, the combined area of the four triangles is $4 \\cdot \\frac 32=6$. Furthermore, the area of the smaller square is $9$. We add these to see that the area of the large square is $9+6=15\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let us find the area of the triangles and the unit squares: on each side, there are two triangles. They both have one leg of length $1$, and let's label the other legs $x$ for one of the triangles and $y$ for the other. Note that $x + y = 3$.The area of each of the triangles is $\\frac{x}{2}$ and $\\frac{y}{2}$, and there are $4$ of each. So now, we need to find $4\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Expanding out the fractions, we get $4\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right) = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y) = 2(3) = 6$.So, the area of the square we need is $25- (4+6) = 15\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Proceed as in solution 1 to get $x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0$.</p><p>Notice that the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{x^2+(5-x)^2}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.

        "<p>By inspection, we can see that the area of the largest square would be the area of the middle square formed by the vertices of the shaded squares plus half the combined area of the four smaller rectangles.
