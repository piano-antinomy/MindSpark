        "<p>Since Rachelle uses $3$ pounds of meat to make $8$ hamburgers, she uses $\\frac{3}{8}$ pounds of meat to make one hamburger. She'll need 24 times that amount of meat for 24 hamburgers, or $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot 24 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 9}$.</p>",

      "solutions": [
        "<p>We assume that the price of the pencils remains constant. Convert $\\textdollar 1.43$ and $\\textdollar 1.87$ to cents. Since the price of the pencils is more than one penny, we can find the price of one pencil (in cents) by taking the greatest common divisor of $143$ and $187$, which is $11$. Therefore, Jamar bought $\\frac{143}{11} \\implies 13$ pencils and Sharona bought $\\frac{187}{11} \\implies 17$ pencils. Thus, Sharona bought $17-13 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}$ more pencils than Jamar.</p>",
        "<p>We find the difference between $1.43$ and $1.87$ is $1.87-1.43 = 0.44$, which is the extra cost of Sharona's pencils than Jamar's pencils. Because the difference between the amounts of the pencils they bought must be divided evenly by $0.44$, looking into the answers, $2$ or $4$ is possibly correct. It gives us the price of each pencil should be $0.44/2=0.22$ or $0.44/4=0.11$, respectively. Then we find only $0.11$ can be divided evenly by $1.43$ and $1.87$. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}$</p>",
        "<p>You can quickly tell, if you have memorized your times tables, that $187$ and $143$ are both multiples of $11$. Additionally, the difference is 44 cents. That means that there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}$ more pencils purchased by Sharona because $11\\times4 = 44$.</p>"
