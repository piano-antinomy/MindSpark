        "<p>Note that the $y$-intercepts of line $AB$ and line $CD$ are $0$ and $10$. If the analytic expression for line $AB$ is $y=k_{1}x$, and the analytic expression for line $CD$ is $y=k_{2}x+10$, we have equations: $3k_{1} = 1$ and $2k_{2} + 10 = 9$. Solving these equations, we can find out that $k_{1} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $k_{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, we can determine that the expression for line $AB$ is $y=\\frac{1}{3}x$ and the expression for line $CD$ is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x + 10$. When $x=15$, the coordinates that line $AB$ and line $CD$ pass through are $(15, 5)$ and $\\left(15, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)$, and $(15, 5)$ lies perfectly on one vertex of the rectangle while the $y$ coordinate of $\\left(15, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)$ is out of the range $3 \\leq y \\leq 5$ (lower than the bottom left corner of the rectangle $(15, 3)$). Considering that the $y$ value of the line $CD$ will only decrease, and the $y$ value of the line $AB$ will only increase, there will not be another point on the rectangle that lies on either of the two lines. Thus, we can conclude that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1}.$</p><p>~<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Bloggish\" title=\"User:Bloggish\">Bloggish</a></p>"

We know that the numbers $9$, $8$, and $7$ must belong in different sets, as putting any $2$ numbers in $1$ set will either pass or match the limit of $15$ per set, and we would then still need to add $1$ more number after that. Note that these numbers must be distinct, as Alina only has $1$ of each number, and order does not matter in the sets. Starting with the set that includes the number $9$, the next two numbers must add up to $6$, and there are $\\textbf{2}$ ways of doing this $(2,4) (1,5)$.

If you have closely studied magic squares, you might know that in a three by three magic square that is to be filled in with the integers $1$ through $9$, the center of the square would be $5$ (the average of the numbers), and the numbers in the corners should be even(*). The such pairs (disregarding order) are $(2,8)$ and $(4,6).$ Let\u2019s fix the position of $2$ to be the top left corner. This would make $8$ in the bottom right corner. We can have either $4$ or $6$ to be in the top right corner, for a total of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2}$ such groups of three.

Label the nine small squares within the magic square from $a$ to $i$ from left to right, top to bottom. Firstly, we know that $a+i$ and $c+g$ sum to $10$ since the center square is $5$. Thus, $a$ and $i$ must have the same parity, and so must $c$ and $g$. Suppose that $a$ and $c$ have different parity. Since $a+b+c=15$, $b$ must be even. By a similar argument, $h$ must also be even, and so must $d$ and $f$. Our initial assumption is that one of $a$ and $c$ is odd and the other is even; however, we end up with six even numbers needed to fill in the square, but there are only four even integers from $1$ to $9$. Now suppose that all of $a, c, g,$ and $i$ are odd. This would make each of $b, d, f,$ and $h$ odd, but clearly we do not have enough odd numbers to make all nine numbers odd. Thus, each corner square must be even.</p><p>~ Brian__Liu</p>"
