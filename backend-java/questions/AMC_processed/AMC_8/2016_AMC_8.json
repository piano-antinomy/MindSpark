Next, let's move on to the second piece of information that was given to us. $RST$ is divisible by 3. So, according to the divisibility by 3 rule, the sum of $RST$ has to be a multiple of 3. The only 2 big enough are 9 and 12 and since 5 is already given. The possible sums of $RT$ are 4 and 7. So, the possible values for $R$ are 1,3,4,3 and the possible values of $T$ are 3,1,3,4.

Using that we also know that 3 is the only possible value for 3. So, we have $PQRST$ = $PQ453$ so the possible values are 1 and 2 for $P$ and $Q$. Using the divisibility rule of 4 we know that $QR$ has to be divisible by 4. So, either 14 or 24 are the possibilities, and 24 is divisible by 4.

The first way is the most obvious, and that is to multiply the base times the height ($16\\cdot15$) and then divide it by two. The second way is, in a way, a little more complex. Note that $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$ are congruent. This means that if we find the area of one triangle, we can just multiply it's area by 2 and we've found the area of the larger triangle $ABC$. But since we always divide by two, as it is in the formula for finding the area of a triangle, the multiply by two and divide by two cancel out, giving us that if we just multiply base times height of $\\triangle ACD$, we will get the area of $\\triangle ABC$.</p><p>Now you might think: \"But what is the other way of finding the area\". Well that is $AC$, which would be the base, times $DE$, the radius, which would be the height. </p><p>The first way to find the area gives us the area of the $\\triangle ABC$, $\\frac{15\\cdot16}{2}=120$. This gives us $120=AC\\cdot r$ ($r$ signifies radius). We can find $AC$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ACD$. The two legs are $8$ and $15$, which gives us that the hypotenuse, $AC$, is equal to $17$. </p><p>Now that we have an equation with only one variable for the radius, $120=17r$, we can just solve for the radius. We get $r=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{120}{17}}$. </p><p>This may seem like a lengthy explanation, but doing it yourself when you know what to do, it actually takes very little time.
