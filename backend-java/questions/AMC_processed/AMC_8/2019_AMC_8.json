Since soft drinks cost $1.00$ dollar each, they can buy 3 soft drinks, which makes them spend $30.00$ Since they bought 6 sandwiches and 3 soft drinks, they bought a total of $9$ items. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }9}$.</p><p>- SBose</p>",

We have to satisfy the equation of\\[4.50s+d=30\\]In the question, it states that Ike and Mike buys as many sandwiches as possible. So, we drop the number of sodas for a while.We have: \\begin{align*} 4.50s&=30 \\\\ s&=\\frac{30}{4.5} \\\\ s&=6R3 \\end{align*}We don't want a remainder so the maximum number of sandwiches is $6$.The total money spent is $6\\cdot 4.50=27$.The number of dollar left to spent on sodas is $30-27=3$ dollars.$3$ dollars can buy $3$ sodas leading us to a total of $6+3=9$ items.

        "<p>If he travels $15$ miles at a speed of $30$ miles per hour, he travels for 30 min.

You also know that he has to travel $55$ miles per hour for some time, so $d=55t$. Plug that in for d to get $55t = 10+50t$ and $t=2$ and since $d=55t$, $d = 2\\cdot55 =110$, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 110}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $h$ be the amount of hours Qiang drives after his first 15 miles. Average speed, which we know is $50$ mph, means total distance over total time.

        "<p>We first start by setting the total number of points as $28$, since $\\text{LCM}(4,7) = 28$. However, we see that this does not work since we surpass the number of points just with the information given ($28\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}+28\\cdot\\frac{2}{7} + 15 = 30$ $(> 28)$ ). Next, we can see that the total number of points scored is $56$ as, if it is more than or equal to $84$, at least one of the others will score more than 2 points. With this, we have that Alexa, Brittany, and Chelsea score: $56\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}+56\\cdot\\frac{2}{7} + 15 = 45$, and thus, the other seven players would have scored a total of $56-45 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} 11}$.

        "<p>Adding together Alexa's and Brittany's fractions, we get $\\frac{15}{28}$ as the fraction of the total number of points they scored together. However, this is just a ratio, so we can introduce a variable: $\\frac{15x}{28x}$ where $x$ is the common ratio. Let $y$ and $z$ and $w$ be the number of people who scored 1, 2, and 0 points, respectively. Writing an equation, we have $\\frac{13x}{28x} = 15 + y + 2z + 0w.$ We want all of our variables to be integers. Thus, we want $15 + y + 2z = 0 \\pmod {13}.$ Simplifying, $y+2z = 11 \\pmod {13}.$ The only possible value, as this integer sum has to be less than $7 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 15,$ must be 11. Therefore, $y+2z = 11,$ and the answer is $\\boxed{ \\textbf{(B) 11}}$.</p><p>- ab2024</p>",
        "<p>We can rewrite the question as an algebraic equation: $\\frac{1}{4} x + \\frac{2}{7} x + 15 + y = x$, where $x$ represents the total amount of points and $y$ the amount of points the $7$ other players scored. From there, we add the two fractions to get $\\frac{15}{28} x + 15 + y = x$. Subtracting $\\frac{15}{28} x$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{13}{28} x = y + 15$. We multiply each side by $28$ to get rid of the denominator, in which we get $13x = 420 + 28y$. Now let\u2019s think of this logically. This equation is telling us that if you add $420$ and $28$ times the amount of points scored by the extra $7$ players, you get $13$ times the amount of points total. And since we have to have a whole number of points total, this means that $420 + 28y$ must be divisible by $13$. Plugging in all the answer choices for $y$, we find that the only answer that makes $420 + 28y$ divisible by $13$ is $\\boxed{ \\textbf{(B) 11}}$.</p><p>~ilee0820</p>"

Since each person must have at least $2$ apples, we can remove $2*3$ apples from the total that need to be sorted. With the remaining $18$ apples, we can use stars and bars to determine the number of possibilities. Assume there are $18$ stars in a row, and $2$ bars, which will be placed to separate the stars into groups of $3$. In total, there are $18$ spaces for stars $+ 2$ spaces for bars, for a total of $20$ spaces. We can now do $20 \\choose 2$. This is because if we choose distinct $2$ spots for the bars to be placed, each combo of $3$ groups will be different, and all apples will add up to $18$. We can also do this because the apples are indistinguishable. $20 \\choose 2$ is $190$, therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }190}$.</p><p><br/>~goofytaipan91</p>",
