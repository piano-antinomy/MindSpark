        "<p>Each folder can also be $5/2$ dollars, and $20\\%$ can be shown as $(1/5)$. We can multiply $(5/2) \\cdot (1/5) = (1/2)$. $(1/2)$ is also $50$ cents or the amount of money that is saved after the $20\\%$ discount. So each folder is $2.50-0.5 = \\textdollar2$.Since Karl bought 5 folders all of the folders after the discount is $(5)(2) = 10$, and the money bought before the discount is $(5)(2.50) = \\textdollar12.50$. To find the money Karl saves all we have to do is subtract $12.50 - 10 = 2.50$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\textdollar 2.50}$.</p>",
        "<p>Having a $20\\%$ off sale is equivalent to a \"Buy 4 get 1 free\" sale. Thus, he would have saved the price of 1 folder, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\textdollar 2.50}$.</p><p>-JeffersonJ</p>"
