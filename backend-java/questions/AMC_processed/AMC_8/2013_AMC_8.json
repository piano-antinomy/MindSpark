        "<p>Extend line AD such that it intersects line FG. Call the intersection K. If we assign an arbitrary value to the side lengths of the squares, such as 2, the base of the now formed triangle AJK would have a length of 3, while the height would be 4. The area of triangle AJK would then be 6, and the rectangle EDKF would have an area of 2. 6 + 2 = 8, and since all of the squares' areas add up to a total of 12 (if each has side length 2), we obtain (12 - 8)/12 for the shaded part of the diagram which yields 4/12 = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac {1}{3}}$</p><p>~ martianrunner</p>"
