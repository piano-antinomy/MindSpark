To use this formula, we scale the figure down by $9$; this will give the height a length of $\\sqrt{\\frac{16+9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{9}} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Now, scaling back up by $9$, the height $DC$ is $9 \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = 15$.

For the number to be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$; since the sum of the three $5$s is $15$, which is already a multiple of $3$, it must also be the case that $x+x=2x$ is a multiple of $3$.

        "<p>We will show that $22$, $11$, $22$, $44$, and $22$ meters are the heights of the trees from left to right. We are given that all tree heights are integers, so since Tree 2 has height $11$ meters, we can deduce that Trees 1 and 3 both have a height of $22$ meters. There are now three possible cases for the heights of Trees 4 and 5 (in order for them to be integers), namely heights of $11$ and $22$, $44$ and $88$, or $44$ and $22$. Checking each of these, in the first case, the average is $17.6$ meters, which doesn't end in $.2$ as the problem requires. Therefore, we consider the other cases. With $44$ and $88$, the average is $37.4$ meters, which again does not end in $.2$, but with $44$ and $22$, the average is $24.2$ meters, which does. Consequently, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }24.2}$.</p>",

Once again, apply our observation for solving for the Tree $4$'s height. Tree $4$ can't be $11$ meters for the sum of the five tree heights to still end with $1$. Therefore, the Tree $4$ is $44$ meters tall. Now, Tree $5$ can either be $22$ or $88$. Find the average height for both cases of Tree $5$. Doing this, we realize the Tree $5$ must be $22$ for the average height to end with $0.2$ and that the average height is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 24.2}$.</p>",
        "<p>As in Solution 1, we shall show that the heights of the trees are $22$, $11$, $22$, $44$, and $22$ meters.

We note that $0.2 = \\frac{1}{5}$, so in order for $\\frac{S}{5}$ to end in $.2$, $S$ must be one more than a multiple of $5$. Moreover, as all the heights are integers, the heights of Tree 1 and Tree 3 are both $22$ meters. At this point, our table looks as follows:\\[\\begingroup \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{10pt} \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.5} \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \\hline Tree 1 & 22 meters \\\\ Tree 2 & 11 meters \\\\ Tree 3 & 22 meters \\\\ Tree 4 & \\rule{0.5cm}{0.15mm} meters \\\\ Tree 5 & \\rule{0.5cm}{0.15mm} meters \\\\ \\hline Average height & \\rule{0.5cm}{0.15mm}\\text{ .}2 meters \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\endgroup\\]</p><p>If Tree 4 now has a height of $11$, then Tree 5 would need to have height $22$, but in that case $S$ would equal $88$, which is not $1$ more than a multiple of $5$. So we instead take Tree 4 to have height $44$. Then the sum of the heights of the first 4 trees is $22+11+22+44 = 99$, so using a height of $22$ for Tree 5 gives $S=121$, which is $1$ more than a multiple of $5$ (whereas $88$ gives $S = 187$, which is not). Thus the average height of the trees is $\\frac{121}{5} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }24.2}$ meters.</p>",
        "<p>Since we know that the tree heights have to be integers, then it is immediate that Tree 1 and 3 have a height of $22$.

The two multiples of eleven (eleven because all of the tree heights have to be a multiple of eleven if they are integers) that come to mind are $66$ and $121$.

Both of these are valid solutions, so the 4th-to-last number can be either $1$ or $8$. If it is $1$, then by the argument we have just made, the 5th-to-last number has to be $2$, the 6th-to-last number has to be $4$, and the 7th-to-last number, which is the first number, must be either $1$ or $8$. In this way, we have ultimately found two solutions: $N=1$ and $N=8$.</p><p>On the other hand, if the 4th-to-last number is $8$, substituting $8$ into the inverse formulae shows that the 5th-to-last number is either $16$ or $\\frac{7}{3}$, but the latter is not an integer. Substituting $16$ shows that if $I$ is even, $I=32$, but if I is odd, $I=5$, and both of these are valid. If the 6th-to-last number is $32$, then the first number must be $64$, since $\\frac{31}{3}$ is not an integer; if the 6th-to-last number is $5,$ then the first number has to be $10$, as $\\frac{4}{3}$ is not an integer. This means that, in total, there are $4$ solutions for $N$, specifically, $1$, $8$, $10$, and $64$, which sum to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }83}$.</p>"

        "<p>Firstly, observe that a single student can't receive $4$ or $5$ awards because this would mean that one of the other students receives no awards. Thus, each student must receive either $1$, $2$, or $3$ awards. If a student receives $3$ awards, then the other two students must each receive $1$ award; if a student receives $2$ awards, then another student must also receive $2$ awards and the remaining student must receive $1$ award. We consider each of these two cases in turn.</p><p>If a student receives three awards, there are $3$ ways to choose which student this is, and $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways to give that student $3$ out of the $5$ awards. Next, there are $2$ students left and $2$ awards to give out, with each student getting one award. There are clearly just $2$ ways to distribute these two awards out, giving $3\\cdot\\binom{5}{3}\\cdot 2=60$ ways to distribute the awards in this case.</p><p>In the other case, two students receive $2$ awards and one student receives $1$ award. We know there are $3$ choices for which student gets $1$ award. There are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to do this. Then, there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to give the first student his two awards, leaving $3$ awards yet to be distributed. There are then $\\binom{3}{2}$ ways to give the second student his $2$ awards. Finally, there is only $1$ student and $1$ award left, so there is only $1$ way to distribute this award. This results in $\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot 1\\cdot 3 =90$ ways to distribute the awards in this case. Adding the results of these two cases, we get $60+90=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }150}$.</p>",
        "<p>Without the restriction that each student receives at least one award, we could take each of the awards and choose one of the $3$ students to give it to. This would be $3^5$ ways to distribute the awards in total. Now we need to subtract the cases where at least one student doesn't receive an award. If a student doesn't receive an award, there are $3$ choices for which student that is, so $2^5$ ways of choosing a student to receive each of the awards; in total, $3\\cdot32=96$.</p><p>However, if $2$ students both don't receive an award, then this case would be counted twice among the $96$, so we need to add back in these cases. Said in other words, $2$ students not receiving an award is equivalent to $1$ student receiving $5$ awards, and there are $3$ choices for whom that student would be. To finish, the total number of ways to distribute the awards is $243 - 96+3$, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }150}$.</p>"

Taking the square root of both sides (and using the fact that lengths are non-negative) gives $\\frac{24s}{24s+25d}=\\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, and cross-multiplying now gives $120s = 96s + 100d \\Rightarrow 24s = 100d \\Rightarrow \\frac{d}{s} = \\frac{24}{100} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{6}{25}}$.</p><p><br/>Note: Once we obtain $\\tfrac{24s}{24s+25d} = \\tfrac{4}{5},$ to ease computation, we may take the reciprocal of both sides to yield $\\tfrac{24s+25d}{24s} = 1 + \\tfrac{25d}{24s} = \\tfrac{5}{4},$ so $\\tfrac{25d}{24s} = \\tfrac{1}{4}.$ Multiplying both sides by $\\tfrac{24}{25}$ yields the same answer as before. </p><p>~peace09</p><p>~Minor Edits by WrenMath</p>",
