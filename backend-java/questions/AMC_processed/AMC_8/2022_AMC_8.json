      "question": "<p>Henry the donkey has a very long piece of pasta. He takes a number of bites of pasta, each time eating $3$ inches of pasta from the middle of one piece. In the end, he has $10$ pieces of pasta whose total length is $17$ inches. How long, in inches, was the piece of pasta he started with?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>Let's say that the first strand of pasta he had is x. The first time he takes a bite of this strand will make it 2 pieces. This is x - 3. The second time he takes the bites of EACH strand will become (x - 3) * 3(2). The 2 is for the two bites he took, 1 for each strand. This equation is showing that for every bite that he is taking, he is taking off 3 inches. This is being showed in the 3(2). He took 2 bites, each taking off 3 inches. Now, the problem is stating that their are 10 pieces of pasta and the TOTAL length is 17 inches. We have to plug in the total number of bites to the equation (x - 3) * 3( ). To find this out, we can see that for the number of strands there are, he took 1 less bite than that number. For example, if there are 2 pieces, he took 1 bite to get those. Since there are 10 pieces, he took 9 bites. The equation then becomes, (x - 3) * 3(9) = 17. To solve this, x = 44. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 44}$.</p><p>~~Brainiacs77~~</p>",
        "<p>If there are $10$ pieces of pasta, Henry took $10-1=9$ bites. Each of these $9$ bites took $3$ inches of pasta out, so all his bites in total took away $9\\cdot 3 = 27$ inches of pasta. Thus, the original piece of pasta was $27+17=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 44}$ inches long.</p><p>~wamofan</p>"

        "<p>Assign the leaves to $0, 1, 2,$ and $3$ modulo $4,$ and let $0$ be the starting leaf. We then use generating functions with relation to the change of leaves. For example, from $3$ to $1$ would be a change of $2,$ and from $1$ to $2$ would be a change of $1.$ This generating function is equal to $(x+x^2+x^3)^4.$ It is clear that we want the coefficients in the form of $x^{4n},$ where $n$ is a positive integer. One application of roots of unity filter gives us a successful case count of $\\frac{81+1+1+1}{4} = 21.$</p><p>Therefore, the answer is $\\frac{21}{3^4}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{7}{27}}.$</p><p>~sigma</p>",
        "<p>Let the leaves be $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0),$ and $(1,1)$ on the coordinate plane, with the cricket starting at $(0,0)$. Then we write a generating function. We denote $x$ a change in the x-value of the cricket, and similarly for $y$. Then our generating function is $(x+y+xy)^4,$ and we wish to compute the number of terms in which the exponents of both x and y are even. To do this, we first square to get $(x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2 + 2xy + 2x^2y + 2xy^2)^2$. Note that every term squared will give even powers for x and y, so that gives us $3 + 4\\cdot3 = 15.$ Then every combination of $x^2, y^2,$ and $x^2y^2$ will also give us even powers for x and y, so that yields $6$ more terms, for a total of $21.$ Now in total there $3^4 = 81$ possible sequences, so $21/81$ gives us the answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{7}{27}}.$</p><p>~littlefox_amc</p>"
