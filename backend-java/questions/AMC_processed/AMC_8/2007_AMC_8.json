      "solutions": [
        "<p>At the beginning of the problem, the Unicorns had played $y$ games and they had won $x$ of these games. From the information given in the problem, we can say that $\\frac{x}{y}=0.45.$ Next, the Unicorns win 6 more games and lose 2 more, for a total of $6+2=8$ games played during district play. We are told that they end the season having won half of their games, or $0.5$ of their games. We can write another equation: $\\frac{x+6}{y+8}=0.5.$ This gives us a system of equations:$\\frac{x}{y}=0.45$ and $\\frac{x+6}{y+8}=0.5.$We first multiply both sides of the first equation by $y$ to get $x=0.45y.$ Then, we multiply both sides of the second equation by $(y+8)$ to get $x+6=0.5(y+8).$ Applying the Distributive Property gives yields $x+6=0.5y+4.$ Now we substitute $0.45y$ for $x$ to get $0.45y+6=0.5y+4.$ Solving gives us $y=40.$ Since the problem asks for the total number of games, we add on the last 8 games to get the solution $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 48}$.</p>",
        "<p>We can check each answer choice from left to right to see which one is correct. Suppose the Unicorns played $48$ games in total. Then, after district play, they would have won $24$ games. Now, consider the situation before district play. The Unicorns would have won $18$ games out of $40$. Converting to a percentage, $18/40 = 45\\%$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$.</p><p>Note: If A didn't work, we would have similarly tested the other choices until we found one that did.</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cxsmi\" rel=\"nofollow\">cxsmi</a></p>",
        "<p>We know that $45\\%=\\frac9{20}$. Therefore, the number of games before district play must be a multiple of $20$ in order for the number of games won to be an integer. The Unicorns played $6+2=8$ more games during district play. The only answer choice that is $8$ more than a multiple of $20$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$.</p>",
        "<p>At the start of the problem we figure out the Unicorns have won $45\\%$ of their games, which can be represented by $\\frac9{20}$. Since this is a simplified fraction and not necessarily the amount of games they have played, we can add a variable (in this case I am using $x$) to the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{9x}{20x}$. We then know that during the district play they have won 6 more games and lost 2 of them for a total of 6+2=8 games played. We then can add it to our fraction we have built to make $\\frac{9x+6}{20x+8}$. We also know that the fraction is equal to $\\frac1{2}$. Putting these equations together we get $\\frac{9x+6}{20x+8}=\\frac1{2}$. Now we can cross multiply to come out with $18x+12=20x+8$. We now solve for $x$!$18x+12=20x+8$ ----> $4=2x$ ----> $2=x$. After we get $x$ which comes out to be 2 we then plug it back into the denominator to get $20(2)+8$ which is equal to 48, so the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 48}$. </p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Am24\" rel=\"nofollow\">AM24</a></p>"
