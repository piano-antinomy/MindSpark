      "question": "<p>I'm thinking of two whole numbers. Their product is 24 and their sum is 11. What is the larger number?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$. Then we have $x+y=11$ and $xy=24$. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x=11-y$, and substituting this into the second equation gives $(11-y)(y)=24$. Simplifying this gives $-y^2+11y=24$, or $y^2-11y+24=0$. This factors as $(y-3)(y-8)=0$, so $y=3$ or $y=8$, and the corresponding $x$ values are $x=8$ and $x=3$. These are essentially the same answer: one number is $3$ and one number is $8$, so the largest number is $8, \\boxed{\\text{D}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Use the answers to attempt to \"reverse engineer\" an appropriate pair of numbers. Looking at option $A$, guess that one of the numbers is $3$. If the sum of two numbers is $11$ and one is $3$, then other must be $11 - 3 = 8$. The product of those numbers is $3\\cdot 8 = 24$, which is the second condition of the problem, so our numbers are $3$ and $8$.</p><p>However, $3$ is the smaller of the two numbers, so the answer is $8$ or $\\boxed{D}$.</p><p>We go through the divisor pairs of $24$ to see which two numbers sum to $11$. The numbers clearly cannot be negative. If one was negative, then the other must also be negative in order to multiply to a positive product, but it would be impossible for the numbers to add up to a positive sum. So, we look at the positive divisor pairs of $24$, namely $1$ and $24$, $2$ and $12$, $3$ and $8$, and $4$ and $6$. The only pair of numbers that sums to $11$ is $3$ and $8$. The larger number is $8$, so the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.</p>",

        "<p>Since the number is even, the last digit must be $2$ or $4$. To make the smallest possible number, the ten-thousands digit must be as small as possible, so the ten-thousands digit is $1$. Simillarly, the thousands digit has second priority, so it must also be as small as possible once the ten-thousands digit is decided, so the thousands digit is $2$. Similarly, the hundreds digit needs to be the next smallest number, so it is $3$. However, for the tens digit, we can't use $4$, since we already used $2$ and the number must be even, so the units digit must be $4$ and the tens digit is $9, \\boxed{\\text{E}}$(The number is $12394$.)</p>",
        "<p>We know that the smallest possible number is $12349$. However, $12349$ is an odd number.

        "<p>This is equivalent to asking for the probability that at least one of the numbers is a multiple of $5$, since if one of the numbers is a multiple of $5$, then the product with it and another integer is also a multiple of $5$, and if a number is a multiple of $5$, then since $5$ is prime, one of the factors must also have a factor of $5$, and $5$ is the only multiple of $5$ on a die, so one of the numbers rolled must be a $5$. To find the probability of rolling at least one $5$, we can find the probability of not rolling a $5$ and subtract that from $1$, since you either roll a $5$ or not roll a $5$. The probability of not rolling a $5$ on either dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6} \\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{6} \\right)=\\frac{25}{36}$.
