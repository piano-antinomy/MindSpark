        "<p>7 hours have passed since 12:00 pm and 7 hours = 420 minutes because there are 60 minutes in an hour. Because every 35 minutes, the clock is ahead by 5 minutes, you need to divide 420 by 35 to find out how many times it happens. 420 divided by 35 is 12. Then you would multiply 12 by 5 because the clock is ahead by 5 minutes. 12 times 5 is 60, so that means that the clock is ahead by 60 minutes.

We use vectors. WLOG suppose the cube has sides of length $2$.

        "<p>We compute $2^8+1=257$. We're all familiar with what $6^3$ is, namely $216$, which is too small. The smallest cube greater than it is $7^3=343$. $2^{18}+1$ is too large to calculate, but we notice that $2^{18}=(2^6)^3=64^3$, which therefore will clearly be the largest cube less than $2^{18}+1$. So, the required number of cubes is $64-7+1= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }58}$.</p>",
        "<p>First, $2^8+1=257$. Then, $2^{18}+1=262145$. Now, we can see how many perfect cubes are between these two parameters. By guessing and checking, we find that it starts from $7$ and ends with $64$. Now, by counting how many numbers are between these, we find the answer to be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }58}$.</p>",
        "<p>First, we realize that question writers like to trick us. We know that most people will be calculating the lowest and highest number whose cubes are within the range. The answer will be the highest number $-$ the lowest number $+ 1$. People will forget the $+1$ so the only possibilities are C and E. We can clearly see that C is too small so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }58}$.</p>",
        "<p>There is not so much guessing and checking after we find that it starts from $7$ because $7^3=343$, which is over $2^8+1=257$. We can start guessing with the 10, answer C, as it is the middle value. Adding 10 to 7 gives us 17 and $17^3 = 4,913$, which is a bit low. So, we move \"up\" to 57, answer D. Adding 57 to 7 gives us 64 and $64^3 = 262,144$, which is perfect for the $2^{18}+1=262,145$. But we are not done. Since it is inclusive, we must add 1 to this solution, which give us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }58}$.</p>",
        "<p>We can immediately evaluate $2^8+1$ which gives us $257$ and the smallest perfect cube greater than that is $343 = 7^3$, and you also immediately notice that $2^{18} = (2^6)^3 = 64^3$. Now, all we have to do is count the cubes, which equals:\\begin{align}64-7+1 &amp;= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }58}\\end{align}</p><p>-jb2015007</p>"
