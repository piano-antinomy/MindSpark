We have $3$ choices for the second digit, since we already used up one of the digits, and $2$ choices for the third, and finally just $1$ choices for the fourth and final one. $2*3*2*1$ is 12, but there are 2 zeros that have been counted as different numbers, so divide by 2 to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 6}$.</p>",
