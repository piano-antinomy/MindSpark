When we expand the parenthesis, it would become $x^{2}+4x+4+x^{2}+2x+x^{2}$. Then we combine like terms to get $3x^{2}+6x+4$ which equals $15553$.

        "<p>We know that two odd numbers sum to an even number, so we can easily say that odd numbers $1-25$ can be included in the list, making for $13$ elements. But, how do we know we can't include even numbers for a higher element value? Well, to get a higher element value than $13$, odd numbers as well as even numbers would have to be included in the list (since there are only $12$ even numbers from $1-25$, and many of those even numbers are the sum of even numbers). However, for every even value we add to our odd list, we have to take away an odd number because there are either two odd numbers that sum to that even value, or that even value and another odd number will sum to an odd number later in the list. So, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13}$ elements is the highest we can go.</p>",
        "<p>The smallest sum of a number $a + b$ where $b \\geq a$ is $a + a = 2a$ as we are using the smallest value of $b$. Using this, we can say that if $12$ were an element of $S$, then one of the sums (the smallest) would be $12 + 12 = 24 < 25$. Thus $13$ must be the smallest element. So the largest amount of elements that could be in $S$ is the list of numbers from $13$ to $25$ as they all work.

        "<p>The total number of possible systems is $2^9 = 512$, with $8$ possible sets of coefficients per equation. We will use complementary counting to find the number of systems which only have the solution $(0, 0, 0)$ and subtract that from the total. Similar to what is observed in Solution 3, if any equation is repeated or $0x + 0y + 0z = 0$, there will only be two or fewer equations for three variables, making one unique solution impossible. Therefore, we must choose $3$ different equations from $7$ possible ones, giving $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 210$ systems. However, there are two exceptions to consider, which will have more than one solution. The first is of the form $x + y + z = 0$, $x + y = 0$, $z = 0$; the second is of the form $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $x + y = 0$. In both cases, there are $3$ ways to choose the variables in the equations, and then $6$ ways to arrange them, giving $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 36$ exceptions.

        "<p>If angle $ADC$ was a right angle, it would be much easier. Thus, first pretend that $ADC$ is a right angle. $ABCD$ is now a square. WLOG, let each of the side lengths be 1. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of line $AE$, which is $\\sqrt{5}/2$. We want the measure of angle $BFC$, so to work closer to it, we should try finding the length of line $BF$. Angle $FAB$ and angle $ABF$ are complementary. Angle $ABF$ and angle $FBC$ are also complementary. Thus, $\\sin FAB=\\cos ABF=\\sin FBC$. $\\sin FAB=\\sin FBC=(1/2)/(\\sqrt{5}/2)=1/\\sqrt{5}$. Since $\\sin FAB=1\\sqrt{5}$,and $AB=1$, $FB=\\sin FAB$. It follows now that $FE=3*\\sqrt{5}/10$. </p><p>Now, zoom in on triangle $BEC$. To use the Law of Cosines on triangle $FBC$, we need the length of $FC$. Use the Law of Cosines on triangle $EFC$. Cos $E=1/\\sqrt{5}$. Thus, after using the Law of Cosines, $FC=\\sqrt{2/5}$. </p><p>Since we now have SSS on $BEC$, we can get use the Law of Cosines. $\\cos BFC=1/-\\sqrt{2}$. $\\arccos 1/-\\sqrt{2}$ is 45, but if the cosine is negative that means that the angle is the supplement of the positive cosine value. $180-45=135$. Angle $BFC$ is $135^\\circ$. </p><p>Realize that, around point F, there will always be 3 right angles, regardless of what angle $ADC$ is. There are only two angles that change when $ADC$ changes. Break up angle $BFC$ into angle $BFB'$, which is always 90 degrees, and angle $B'FC$, which we have discovered to to be half of $ADC$. Thus, when angle $ADC$ is 46 degrees, then $B'FC$ will be 23. $23+90=113$. Angle $BFC$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }113}$ degrees.</p><p><br/></p>"

Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \\[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\\] which would mean \\[S_{2023} < 0\\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0. A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive. </p><p>Going back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then \\[16a - b = 7n\\] and \\[16a = 7n + b,\\] so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.$</p><p>-Rutvik Arora (youtube channel: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgAgmNAQV8WGTOazGYEGwg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgAgmNAQV8WGTOazGYEGwg</a>)-whatdohumanitarianseat made a small edit for a typo</p>",
        "<p>Given that $7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$, we have\\begin{align*} 7S_n &= a_n2^n + 1\\\\ 7S_{n-1} &= a_{n-1}2^{n-1} + 1. \\end{align*}where $a_n$ is integer.</p><p>Notice that \\[S_n = S_{n-1} + 2^{n-1}x_{n-1}.\\]Thus,\\begin{align*} 7(S_n - S_{n-1}) &= 2^{n-1}(2a_n - a_{n-1})\\\\ 7 \\cdot 2^{n - 1}x_{n - 1} &= 2^{n - 1}(2a_n - a_{n - 1})\\\\ 7x_{n-1} &= 2a_n - a_{n-1}. \\end{align*}Obviously, $x_0 = 1$, $S_1 = 1$, $7S_1 = 3 \\times 2^1 + 1$, so $a_1 = 3$. For each $i$, $x_i$ must be 0 or 1, and $a_i$ is an integer, so we can repeat the recursion to yield\\begin{align*} x_1 = \\frac{2a_2 - a_1}{7} = \\frac{2a_2 - 3}{7}\\text{ can only be 1, where }a_2 = 5\\\\ x_2 = \\frac{2a_3 - a_2}{7} = \\frac{2a_3 - 5}{7}\\text{ can only be 1, where }a_3 = 6\\\\ x_3 = \\frac{2a_4 - a_3}{7} = \\frac{2a_4 - 6}{7}\\text{ can only be 0, where }a_4 = 3\\\\ x_4 = \\frac{2a_5 - a_4}{7} = \\frac{2a_5 - 3}{7}\\text{ can only be 1, where }a_5 = 5\\\\ x_5 = \\frac{2a_6 - a_5}{7} = \\frac{2a_6 - 5}{7}\\text{ can only be 1, where }a_6 = 6\\\\ x_6 = \\frac{2a_7 - a_6}{7} = \\frac{2a_7 - 6}{7}\\text{ can only be 0, where }a_7 = 3 \\end{align*}So for any non-negative integer $k$, we can find that $x_{3k + 1} = 1$, $x_{3k + 2} = 1$, $x_{3k + 3} = 0$, \\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 0 + 2 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 1 + 8 \\times  0 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.\\]</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Reda_mandymath\" rel=\"nofollow\">reda_mandymath</a></p>",
        "<p>Using the given conditions, it is evident that $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}=\\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}=a$ (for simplicity). Moreover, because $7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$ is true, an impulse to multiply the numerator and denominator by 7 is created.
