        "<p>The path that the rider takes along the Ferris wheel can be represented by a sinusoidal graph, where $x$ represents the time in seconds. Since $x=0$ is at the crest of the graph and not at the midline, we will use a cosine graph. Therefore, we will use the form:\\[f(x) = A\\cos(Bx - C) + D.\\]</p><p>The graph starts at the lowest point at $0$ feet, then goes up to reach the highest point at $40$ feet, then comes back down. Therefore, the amplitude is $20$ (and negative since it starts at the bottom, not the top), and the vertical shift is $20$. There is no horizontal shift since the lowest point is at $x=0$. It takes $60$ seconds to make one full revolution (the period), so $B = \\frac{2\\pi}{60} = \\frac{\\pi}{30}.$ Now we have all the parts we need for the equation of our graph, and we can set it equal to the height we want, $10.$</p><p>\\[10 = -20\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30}x\\right) + 20.\\]</p><p>We get to $\\frac{1}{2} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30}x\\right)$ and remember that the problem is looking for the first instance of $f(x) = 10$, so $\\frac{\\pi}{30}x = \\frac{\\pi}{3}.$ Solving, we get that $x = \\boxed{\\mathrm{(D) \\ } 10}$.</p><p>~jp06132</p>"

        "<p>Let $S$ be the sum of the numbers. Let $x$ be the number of integers, and the mean be $y$. We have the equation $\\frac{S}{x} = y$. We also have $\\frac{S+15}{x+1} = y+2$ and $\\frac{S+16}{x+2} = y+1$. From the first equation, we have $S = xy$. We can multiply both sides by the denominators of the second and third equations to yield $S+15 = xy+2x+y+2$ and $S+16 = xy+x+2y+2$. Since $S = xy$, we can substitute that into the equations and subtract by $xy$ to get $15 = 2x+y+2$ or $13 = 2x+y$. We also get $x+2y = 14$, and adding the two equations up gives $3x+3y = 27$, or $x+y = 9$. Subtracting $x+y=9$ from $2x+y=13$ gives $x = 4$ and $y = 5$. </p><p>We can check that this is the correct answer by having $4, 9, 6,$ and $1$ as our numbers. The sum is 20, and the mean is 5. Adding 15 gives that the sum is 35, and the number of integers is 5, so the mean is 2, an increase of 2. Adding 1 to the integers gives that the sum is 36, and the number of numbers is 6, for a mean of 6, a decrease of 1.</p><p>We can also prove that since the sum is 20, the number of integers is 4, and the mean is 5, we have $\\frac{20}{4} = 5$, which is true. The second equation gives $\\frac{35}{5} = 7 = 5+2$, which satisfies the condition. We also have $\\frac{36}{6} = 6 = 7-1$, which also satisfies the condition.</p><p>Therefore, since we correctly solved it and checked our work multiple ways, we can be confident that the answer is $\\textbf{(A)}$.</p>"
