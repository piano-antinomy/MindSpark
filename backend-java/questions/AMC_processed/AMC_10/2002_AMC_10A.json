Since the area is an integer the denominator of x must divide either 13 or 7 since $91 = 13\\cdot7$.Seeing how $39 = 3\\cdot13$ and $52 = 4\\cdot13$ assume that the denominator divides 13. Letting $y = \\frac{x}{13}$ the area is now $7y$.Note that (A) and (C) are the only multiples of 7. We know that A doesn't work because that would mean $h$ is $4$ which we ruled out. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 210}$. - megateleportingrobots</p>",
