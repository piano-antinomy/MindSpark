        "<p>We can say the area of one small square is $x^2$, so $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the area of the large square is $4x^2$ so the area of the large square is $16x^2$, so each side is $4x$ so the length of the rectangle is $4x$ and the width of the rectangle is also $4x$. $4x-x=3x$ so $\\dfrac{4x}{3x}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$</p>",
        "<p>Let the side length of one of the squares equal $1$. Then, the width of the rectangle will be $4$, and since the width of the rectangle is the same as the length of the entire shape, the length of the rectangle is $4 - 1 = 3$.

        "<p>Since the number of balls Tyrone and Eric have a specific ratio when Tyrone gives some of his balls to Eric, we can divide the total amount of balls by their respective ratios. Altogether, they have $97+11$ balls, or $108$ balls, and it does not change when Tyrone gives some of his to Eric, since none are lost in the process. After Tyrone gives some of his balls away, the ratio between the balls is $2:1$, and added together is $108$. The two numbers add up to $3$ and we divide $108$ by $3$, and the outcome is $36$. This is the number of balls Eric has, and so doubling that results in the number of balls Tyrone has, which is $72$. $97-72$ is $25$, and $36-11$ is $25$, thus proving our statement true, and the answer is $\\boxed{D=25}$.</p>"

      "solutions": [
        "<p>Tony works $2$ hours a day and is paid $0.50$ dollars per hour for each full year of his age. This basically says that he gets a dollar for each year of his age. So if he is $12$ years old, he gets $12$ dollars a day. We also know that he worked $50$ days and earned $630$ dollars. If he was $12$ years old at the beginning of his working period, he would have earned $12 * 50 = 600$ dollars. If he was $13$ years old at the beginning of his working period, he would have earned $13 * 50 = 650$ dollars. Because he earned $630$ dollars, we know that he was $13$ for some period of time, but not the whole time, because then the money earned would be greater than or equal to $650$. This is why he was $12$ when he began, but turned $13$ sometime during the six month period and earned $630$ dollars in total. So the answer is $13$.The answer is $\\boxed{D}$. We could find out for how long he was $12$ and $13$. $12 \\cdot x + 13 \\cdot (50-x) = 630$. Then $x$ is $20$ and we know that he was $12$ for $20$ days, and $13$ for $30$ days. Thus, the answer is $13$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $x$ equal Tony's age at the end of the period. We know that his age changed during the time period (since $630$ does not evenly divide $50$). Thus, his age at the beginning of the time period is $x - 1$.</p><p>Let $d$ be the number of days Tony worked while his age was $x$. We know that his earnings every day equal his age (since $2 \\cdot 0.50 = 1$). Thus, \\[x \\cdot d + (x - 1)(50 - d) = 630\\] \\[x\\cdot d + 50x - x\\cdot d - 50 + d = 630\\] \\[50x + d = 680\\] \\[x = \\dfrac{680 - d}{50}\\]Since $0 < d <50$, $d = 30$. Then we know that $50x = 650$ and $x = \\boxed{(D) 13}$</p>",
        "<p>Since Tony worked for $50$ days, he has worked for $100$ hours. Let $k$ be his hourly wage. Then, we know that $100k = 630$. </p><p>Dividing both sides by $50$, we get that $2k$(Daily wage, which is equal to his age) $\\approx$ $12.6$. Since we now know that his age was either 12 or 13 during the 6 month span, and we are asked to find his age at the end of this time, the answer is $\\boxed{(D) 13}$</p>"

Recall that to find the previous term, we must add a square number such that it is less than the next square number. $a + n^2 < (n+1)^2$. For this to be true, $a < 2n + 1$. What that means is that given a term $a$, we can find the previous term by adding $n^2$ where $n > \\frac {a-1}{2}$. </p><p><br/>For example, to find the term that precedes $167$, we know that $n>166/2 = 83$. Therefore, $n=84$ and the previous term is $167 + 84^2 = 7223$. The last digit of $7223$ is $3 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3}$</p>"
