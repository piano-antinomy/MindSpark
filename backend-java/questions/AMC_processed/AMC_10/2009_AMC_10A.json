We need to use some larger coins. Let's try: 1 nickel + 3 pennies = 5 + 3 = 8\u00a2 (too small), 2 nickels + 2 pennies = 10 + 2 = 12\u00a2 (too small), 3 nickels + 1 penny = 15 + 1 = 16\u00a2 (too large). We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>B) 25\u00a2: 1 quarter = 25\u00a2, but we need 4 coins. 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 25 + 3 = 28\u00a2 (too large). 5 nickels = 25\u00a2, but we need exactly 4 coins. 4 nickels + 1 penny = 20 + 1 = 21\u00a2 (too small). 3 nickels + 2 pennies = 15 + 2 = 17\u00a2 (too small). We cannot make exactly 25\u00a2 with 4 coins either.</p><p>Wait, let me reconsider. The problem asks which total value could NOT be made. Let me check more carefully:</p><p>A) 15\u00a2: Can we make 15\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins? 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins. We need 4 coins. 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17\u00a2 (too large). 3 nickels = 15\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>B) 25\u00a2: 1 quarter = 25\u00a2, but we need 4 coins. 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 28\u00a2 (too large). 5 nickels = 25\u00a2, but we need exactly 4 coins. 4 nickels + 1 penny = 21\u00a2 (too small). We cannot make exactly 25\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>C) 35\u00a2: 1 quarter + 1 dime = 35\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins. 1 quarter + 1 dime + 2 pennies = 37\u00a2 (too large). 3 dimes + 1 nickel = 30 + 5 = 35\u00a2, but that's only 4 coins. Wait, 3 dimes + 1 nickel = 30 + 5 = 35\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins. This is possible.</p><p>D) 45\u00a2: 1 quarter + 2 dimes = 25 + 20 = 45\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. 1 quarter + 2 dimes + 1 penny = 46\u00a2 (too large). 4 dimes + 1 nickel = 40 + 5 = 45\u00a2, but that's 5 coins. We cannot make exactly 45\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>E) 55\u00a2: 2 quarters + 1 nickel = 50 + 5 = 55\u00a2, but that's only 3 coins. 2 quarters + 1 nickel + 1 penny = 56\u00a2 (too large). 1 quarter + 3 dimes = 25 + 30 = 55\u00a2, but that's only 4 coins. Wait, 1 quarter + 3 dimes = 25 + 30 = 55\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins. This is possible.</p><p>So the values that cannot be made with exactly 4 coins are: A (15\u00a2), B (25\u00a2), and D (45\u00a2). But the problem asks for which one could NOT be made, implying only one answer. Let me check more carefully:</p><p>Actually, let me list all possible combinations of 4 coins and see what totals we can make:</p><p>4 pennies = 4\u00a2</p><p>3 pennies + 1 nickel = 8\u00a2</p><p>2 pennies + 2 nickels = 12\u00a2</p><p>1 penny + 3 nickels = 16\u00a2</p><p>4 nickels = 20\u00a2</p><p>3 nickels + 1 dime = 25\u00a2</p><p>2 nickels + 2 dimes = 30\u00a2</p><p>1 nickel + 3 dimes = 35\u00a2</p><p>4 dimes = 40\u00a2</p><p>3 dimes + 1 quarter = 55\u00a2</p><p>2 dimes + 2 quarters = 70\u00a2</p><p>1 dime + 3 quarters = 85\u00a2</p><p>4 quarters = 100\u00a2</p><p>And combinations with pennies: 3 pennies + 1 dime = 13\u00a2, 2 pennies + 1 nickel + 1 dime = 17\u00a2, 1 penny + 2 nickels + 1 dime = 21\u00a2, etc.</p><p>Looking at the options: A) 15\u00a2 - not in our list, B) 25\u00a2 - possible (3 nickels + 1 dime), C) 35\u00a2 - possible (1 nickel + 3 dimes), D) 45\u00a2 - not in our list, E) 55\u00a2 - possible (3 dimes + 1 quarter).</p><p>So A (15\u00a2) and D (45\u00a2) cannot be made. But the problem asks for which one could NOT be made, implying only one answer. Let me check if I missed any combinations.</p><p>Actually, let me be more systematic. The problem is asking which total value could NOT be the total value of the four coins. Let me check each option:</p><p>A) 15\u00a2: Can we make 15\u00a2 with exactly 4 coins? Let's try: 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15\u00a2, but that's only 2 coins.

We cannot make exactly 15\u00a2 with 4 coins.</p><p>Therefore, the answer is A) 15\u00a2.</p>"

We know for a fact that if we have $2$ normal full circles and one has a radius that is double the other, the smaller circle will always be $4$ times smaller than the larger one (if you didn't know, now you know). Now, we have a semicircle, so the same thing applies but the larger circle is cut in half, so therefore, the semicircle (which has the bigger radius), will be double the size of the small circle that is inscribed in it. Double means that $2$ of the small full circles will be able to fit the larger semi-circle.

        "<p>The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.</p><p>For $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$.

Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.</p>",
        "<p>Notice that $2$ is a prime factor of an integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is even. Therefore, given any sufficiently high positive integral value of $k$, dividing $I_k$ by $2^6$ yields a terminal digit of zero, and dividing by 2 again leaves us with $2^7 \\cdot a = I_k$ where $a$ is an odd integer.Observe then that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}7}$ must be the maximum value for $N(k)$ because whatever value we choose for $k$, $N(k)$ must be less than or equal to $7$.</p><p>\"Isn't this solution incomplete because we need to show that $N(k) = 7$ can be reached?\"</p><p>An example of 7 being reached is 1000064. 1000064 divided by $2^7=128$ is 7813.</p><p>In fact, 1000064 is the ONLY $N(k)$ that satisfies $7$. All others are 6 or lower, because if there are more zeroes, to be divisible by 128 ($2^7$), the last 7 digits must be divisible by 128, but 64 isn't. Meanwhile, if there are less zeroes, we can test by division that they do not work.</p>",
        "<p>As in the first solution, the number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2} 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.

        "<p>Similar to the other solutions, notice that $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2}+64 \\Rightarrow 2^{k+2}5^{k+2}+2^6$. Factoring out $2^6$ we see that</p><p>$I_k = 2^6(2^{k-4}5^{k+2}+1)$</p><p>Notice that for $k < 4$, $2^{k-4}$ will not be an integer, and will \"steal\" some $2$'s from the $2^6$. We don't want this to happen, since we want to maximize the exponent of $2$. We start by considering $k = 4$. Then</p><p>$I_k = 2^6(*5^6+1) \\Rightarrow 2^6(5^6+1)$</p><p>$5^6$ is an odd number; more specifically, it ends in $25$ (all powers of $5$ after $5^1$ end in $25$). Therefore the value in the parentheses will be some large number that ends in $26$. Considering the rules of divisibility, we find that $5^6+1$ is even, so it is divisible by $2$. Now our exponent of $2$ is at $7$. But the divisibility rule for $4$ is the last $2$ digits of the number must be divisible by $4$. We know the last digits: $26$, which is not divisible by $4$. Therefore $5^6 + 1$ is divisible by $2$, but not $4$. Testing more values of $k$, we find that for $k \\ge 5$, the last digit becomes $1$, which means it is not even divisible by $2$. Therefore the highest possible exponent of $2$ that we can reach is $7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $m=k+2$. $v_2(10^m+2^6)=6$ if $m>6$ and $v_2(10^m+2^6)=m$ if $m<6$. However, if $m=6$, then $v_2(10^6+2^6)=v_2(2^6(5^6+1))=6+v_2(5^6+1)$. By LTE, $v_2(5^6-1)=v_2(5-1)+v_2(5+1)+v_2(6)-1=2+1+1-1=3$. Since $v_2(5^6-1)=3$, $v_2(5^6+1)$ must equal $1$. So, the answer is $6+1=7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$</p>",
        "<p>Note that if $k<5$, then $I_k$ is not divisible by $64=2^6$. However, if $k=5$, then $1000064$ is divisible by $64$. So, we can write $I_k$ for $k=5$ as $I_5=64(1+15625)=2^6(1+15625)$. For $k=5$, we see that $I_5=2^6(1+15625)=2^6(15626)$, which is divisible by $2^7$, because there is already a $2^6$ and the $15626$ only adds one more factor of $2$ (the last two digits of $15626$, $26$, are not divisible by $4$). For $k>5$ or $k\\geq6$, there are $(k-5)$ zeroes trailing behind $15625$, giving $I_k=2^6(1+156250...0)$. $156250...0$ is clearly even if there is at least one zero. Then, adding the extra $1$ to the even $156250...0$ gives $156250...01$, which is odd. Thus, for $k>5$, $I_k=2^6(156250...01)$, which is only divisible by $2^6$.
