        "<p>For the statement to be true, we must have both $n$ and $n + 48$ be squares of primes. Support we have the number $x^2$, where $x$ is a positive integer. Then the next perfect square, $(x+1)^2$, is $(x+1)^2 - x^2 = 2x+1$ greater than $x^2$. The next perfect square after that will be $(x+2)^2 = 4x + 4$ greater than $x^2$. In general, the prime $(x+n)^2$ will be $nx + n^2$ greater than $x^2$. However, we must have that $nx + n^2 = 48$. $n$ can take on any value between $1$ and $6$ (if $n$ is equal to $7$, we have $14x + 49$, where $x$ would have to be negative for the difference to be $48$). However, we can eliminate all the cases where $n$ is odd, because we would then have a number of the form $even + odd$, which is odd because $x$ can take only integral values. As such, we consider $n = 2$, $n = 4$, and $n = 6$. If $n = 2$, then $4x + 4 = 48 \\implies x = 11$. Then our squares are $11^2$ and $13^2$, both of which are squares of primes. If $n = 4$, then $8x + 16 = 48 \\implies x = 4$. However, $4$ isn't prime, so we discard this case. Finally, if $n = 6$, then $12x + 36 = 48 \\implies x = 1$. Again, $1$ isn't prime, so we discard this case as well. Thus, we only have $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}~1}$ valid case.</p><p>~ <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cxsmi\" rel=\"nofollow\">cxsmi</a></p>",
        "<p>We know that since it asks for $\\sqrt{n}$, we know that $n$ must be a perfect square. Plus, we need $n$ to be a perfect square of a prime since otherwise $P(n)$ won't be equal to the $\\sqrt{n}$. We can apply the same logic to $\\sqrt{n+48}$, and since we also the difference between two consecutive squares is an odd number, we must have an even number of consecutive odd numbers to sum up to $48$ since it is even. Thus, this leads us to three cases, since if we split 48 into even more consecutive odd numbers we will go into the negatives:</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 23 + 25$</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15$</p><p>$n + 48 = n + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13$</p><p>We know that an odd number, $n$, is equal to the difference of squares between $n/2 - 0.5$ and $n/2 + 0.5$. This means we can test these cases and find $n$ using the least odd number in each case. By looking at the first one, we see that $23/2 - 0.5 = 11$, and squaring it into $121$ and setting it to $n$, we realize this works for the first part where $P(n)$ is equal to the $\\sqrt{n}$. Now, if we add $48$ we get $169$, which works for the second part. If we do this for the second case, $9/2 - 0.5 = 4$, and square it and set it as $n$, we realize that since $\\sqrt{n}$ must be prime and $4$ is composite, so this can't work. Finally for the last case, we do $3/2 - 0.5 = 1$, and since $1^2 = 1$, this case doesn't work since $n$ must be greater than $1$. Thus, our only valid case is the first one and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}~1}$.</p><p>~ neeyakkid23</p>"
