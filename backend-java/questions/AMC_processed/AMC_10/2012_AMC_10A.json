Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$.

        "<p>First, there is only one way for the middle square to be black because it is not affected by the rotation. Then we can consider the corners and edges separately. Let's first just consider the number of ways we can color the corners. There is $1$ case with all-black squares. There are four cases with one white square and all $4$ work. There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares. Then the total number of ways to color the corners is $1+4+2=7$. In essence, the edges work the same way, so there are also $7$ ways to color them.

Thus, there are $8$ cases.<br/>Case 3: 2 white squares. We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this.<br/>Case 4: 3 white squares.Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case.<br/>Case 5: 4 white squares.Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4.Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions.

The same can be said of configurations with $n=2$ when compared to configurations of $n=3$. Thus, we have two cases to examine, $n=1$ and $n=2$, and we count each of these combinations twice.</p><p>(Note: If you aren\u2019t familiar with one-to-one correspondences, think of it like this: the number of ways to choose 4 friends is equal to number of ways to exclude one friend from your friend group. Hence, since the number of ways to choose 1 friend is the same thing as choosing 1 to not be friends with, $n=1$ and $n=4$ have the same number of ways. Similarly, $n=2$ and $n=3$ have the same number of ways as well. ~peelybonehead)</p><p>For $n=1$, if everyone has exactly one friend, that means there must be $3$ pairs of friends, with no other interconnections. The first person has $5$ choices for a friend. There are $4$ people left. The next person has $3$ choices for a friend. There are two people left, and these remaining two must be friends. Thus, there are $15$ configurations with $n=1$.</p><p>For $n=2$, there are two possibilities. The group of $6$ can be split into two groups of $3$, with each group creating a friendship triangle. The first person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to pick two friends from the other five, while the other three are forced together. Thus, there are $10$ triangular configurations. </p><p>However, the group can also form a friendship hexagon, with each person sitting on a vertex, and each side representing the two friends that person has. The first person may be seated anywhere on the hexagon <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/Without_loss_of_generality\" title=\"Without loss of generality\">without loss of generality</a>. This person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ choices for the two friends on the adjoining vertices. Each of the three remaining people can be seated \"across\" from one of the original three people, forming a different configuration. Thus, there are $10 \\cdot 3! = 60$ hexagonal configurations, and in total $70$ configurations for $n=2$.</p><p>As stated before, $n=3$ has $70$ configurations, and $n=4$ has $15$ configurations. This gives a total of $(70 + 15)\\cdot 2 = 170$ configurations, which is option $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 170}$.</p><p>We can also calculate the triangular configurations by applying $\\frac{\\binom{6}{3}}{2} = \\frac{20}{2}=10$ (Because choosing $A$,$B$ and $C$ is the same as choosing $D$,$E$ and $F$.</p><p><br/>For the hexagonal configurations, we know that the total amount of combinations is $6!=720$. However, we must correct for our overcounting because of rotation and reflection. We have that there are ${720 \\over 6 \\cdot 2} = 60$ because there $6$ rotations of the hexagon and 2 reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise) for each valid way.</p><p>We can also calculate the hexagonal configurations by placing each person at a random vertex (6!) and dividing for rotations (by 6) and reflections (by 2): </p><p>For the hexagonal configuration, it is essentially congruent to counting the number of paths that start and end with A. From $A$, we have $5$ options, then the next one has $4$, and so on, so we have: $5\\cdot 4 \\hdots 1 \\cdot 1$, where the final $1$ is because the final point needs to reconnect to $A$. Thus, there are $5! = 120$ ways. Dividing by $2$ since we overcounted by accounting for both directions, we have $120/2 = \\fbox{60}$</p><p>-bigbrain123</p><p>You could ALSO count the hexagonal arrangements by considering the rotation and then reflection. Each arrangement of the six friends maps to a sequence _ _ _ _ _ _, each person is friends with their two neighbors, and the rightmost and leftmost people are friends with each other. Notice that any configuration can be rotated to begin with A, so we have the sequence: A _ _ _ _ _. Now there are $5!$ ways to fill these blanks. For example, ABCDEF. However, since A is friends with both B and F, this sequence can be 'flipped' to yield AFEDCB, which corresponds to the same set of friendships. Since each sequence can be flipped to yield another valid sequence, we have overcounted by a factor of two. Thus the final number of hexagonal configurations = $\\frac{5!}{2} = \\fbox{60}$</p><p>~rawr3507</p>"

This change of variables is just a translation of each $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ by the vector $(0,1,\\dots,k-1)$; in the above solutions, it corresponds to taking the 6 tetrahedrons and gluing them together to form a cube. </p><p>We now compute the volume of the set of $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k}) \\in [0,n-(k-1)]^{k}$ which satisfy $y_{1} < \\dotsb < y_{k}$. As above, we can disregard any $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k})$ such that $y_{i} = y_{j}$ for some $i \\ne j$.

Since there are $k!$ permutations of $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$, the desired volume is equal to $\\frac{1}{k!}$ times the volume of the $k$-dimensional hyper-cube of side length $n-(k-1)$, which is $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$. Hence $T$ has volume $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$ as well and $S$ has volume $(n-(k-1))^{k}$. Hence the desired probability is $\\frac{(n-(k-1))^{k}}{n^{k}}$.</p>",
