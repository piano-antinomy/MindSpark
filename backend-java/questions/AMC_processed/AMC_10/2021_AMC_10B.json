Hence, $-9.42<x<9.42$ $\\implies$ $-9\\leq x\\leq9$, for $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. The number of integer values of $x$ is $9-(-9)+1=19$.

        "<p>Looking at the problem, we see that instead of directly saying $x$, we see that it is $|x|.$ That means all the possible values of $x$ in this case are positive and negative. Rounding $\\pi$ to $3$ we get $3(3)=9.$ There are $9$ positive solutions and $9$ negative solutions: $9+9=18.$ But what about zero?

        "<p>We need to have every even number from $1$ to $6$ at least once before we get an odd number. We find that the probability of the first number being even is $\\dfrac{3}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$. Regardless of what the first number is, the probability of the second number being distinct and even is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$, because now only $2$ even numbers are left. Next, the probability of the third number being even and distinct is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$. The final number must be odd, and it can be any of the $3$ odd numbers, thus $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. Multiplying these all out yields $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{40}$. Now, this is the probability that all even numbers appear exactly once before the odd number, and we haven't accounted for the fact that an even number could appear more than once. Since any even number can appear more than once, we multiply $\\dfrac{1}{40}$ by $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. We could keep multiplying by $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ infinitely before we get an odd number, thus we use the infinite geometric sequence sum formula (we could have $3$ even numbers, all the way to $\\infty$ even numbers before we get our first odd number, so that's why we're summing the probabilities). Our first term, $a_1$ is $\\dfrac{1}{40}$, and the common ratio is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$.

        "<p>To find the probability, we look at the $\\frac{\\text{success region}}{\\text{total possible region}}$. For the coin to be completely contained within the square, we must have the distance from the center of the coin to a side of the square to be at least $\\frac{1}{2}$, as it's the radius of the coin. This implies the $\\text{total possible region}$ is a square with side length $8 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 7$, with an area of $49$. Now, we consider cases where needs to land to partially cover a black region.</p><p><b> Near The Center Square </b></p><p>We can have the center of the coin land within $\\frac{1}{2}$ outside of the center square, or inside of the center square. So, we have a region with $\\frac{1}{2}$ emanating from every point on the exterior of the square, forming four quarter circles and four rectangles. The four quarter circles combine to make a full circle of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the area is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

By symmetry, we can just find the successful region for one of them, then multiply by $4$. Consider the above diagram. We can draw an altitude from the bottom corner of the square to hit the hypotenuse of the green triangle. The length of this when passing through the black region is $\\sqrt 2$, and when passing through the white region (while being contained in the green triangle) is $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, we have to subtract off when it doesn't pass through the red square. Then, it's the hypotenuse of a small isosceles right triangle with side lengths of $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ which is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$ So, the altitude of the green triangle is $\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt 2 + 1}{2}$. Then, recall, the area of an isosceles right triangle is $h^2$, where $h$ is the altitude from the right angle. So, squaring this, we get $\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt 2}{4}$. Now, we have to multiply this by $4$ to account for all of the black triangles, to get $3 + 2\\sqrt 2$ as the final area for this case. </p><p><b> Finishing </b></p><p>Then, to have the coin touching a black region, we add up the area of our successful regions, or $8 + 4\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 3 + 2\\sqrt 2 = 11 + 6\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{4}$. The total region is $49$, so our probability is $\\frac{\\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{4}}{49} = \\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{196}$, which implies $a+b = 44+24 = 68$.

If he has $(6,1,1)$, Beth can take 2 out of the middle of $(6,1,1)$ to get $(2,2,1,1)$ which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice $A$. If he has $(6,2)$, Beth will take out one from the edge, and we get $(5,2)$. Beth can now copy whatever Arjun does, so she will win. </p><p>Next, if he takes one out to get $(x,y,2,1)$, we can either have $(4,1,2,1)$ or $(3,2,2,1)$. If it is the first case, Beth can take the edge 2 out of the 4, which gives us $(2,1,2,1)$ and whatever Arjun does, Beth can do, so she has established a win. If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get $(1,2,2,1)$, in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins.

If $m$ was lower, $y=mx$ would no longer go through some of these points, and there would be less than $300$ lattice points under it.</p><p>Now, we find an upper bound for $m.$ Imagine increasing $m$ slowly and rotating the line $y=mx,$ starting from the lower bound of $m=\\frac{2}{3}.$The upper bound for $m$ occurs when $y=mx$ intersects a lattice point again (look at this problem to get a better idea of what's happening: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2011_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_24\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2011_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_24</a>).</p><p>In other words, we are looking for the first $m > \\frac{2}{3}$ that is expressible as a ratio of positive integers $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q \\le 30.$ For each $q=1,\\dots,30$, the smallest multiple of $\\frac{1}{q}$ which exceeds $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $1, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{3}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\cdots , \\frac{19}{27}, \\frac{19}{28}, \\frac{20}{29}, \\frac{21}{30}$ respectively, and the smallest of these is $\\frac{19}{28}.$</p><p>Alternatively, see the method of finding upper bounds in solution 2.</p><p>The lower bound is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and the upper bound is $\\frac{19}{28}.$ Their difference is $\\frac{1}{84},$ so the answer is $1 + 84 = \\boxed{85}.$</p><p>~JimY~Minor edits by sl_hc</p><p>An alternative would be using Farey fractions and the mediant theorem to find the upper bound. $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{7}{10}$ gives $\\frac{9}{13},$ and so on using Farey addition.</p><p>An alternative approach with the same methodology can be done using Pick's Theorem.

        "<p>Based on area ratios between a square of side length $30$ and a triangle with base $30$, we estimate that the slope $m$ of the line we want is approximately $\\frac{2}{3}$. Following this estimate, we see if there are approximately $30 \\cdot 30 - 300 = 600$ lattice points above the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$.</p><p>Counting the number of lattice points with $x=1$ above the line, the number of lattice points with $x=2$ above the line, and so on, we find that the total number of lattice points above the line is $30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \\ldots+ 10$, with the even integers repeating every third term. We see that the average of the $30$ terms is $20$, which means that exactly $20 \\cdot 30 = 600$ lattice points above the line as desired. This gives a lower bound because any decrease in the slope of the line would cause points that were already on the line to shift to being above it.</p><p>To find the upper bound, notice that each lattice point less than $1$ unit above the line is either $\\frac{1}{3}$ or $\\frac{2}{3}$ above. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates more than the y-value of the lower x-coordinates. So, we turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ for which the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20$. The point $(30,20)$ is already counted, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will first hit the point $(28,19)$ since $(28, \\frac{56}{3})$ is the closest to it. The equation of the line which goes through both the origin and $(28,19)$ is $y=\\frac{19}{28}x$. This gives an upper bound of $m=\\frac{19}{28}$. </p><p>Taking the upper bound of $m$ and subtracting the lower bound yields $\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}$.
