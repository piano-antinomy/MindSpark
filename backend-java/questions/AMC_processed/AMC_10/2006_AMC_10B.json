It is easy to see that rhombus $ABCD$ is made up of <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/Equilateral_triangle\" title=\"Equilateral triangle\">equilateral triangles</a> $DAB$ and $DCB$. Let the lengths of the sides of rhombus $ABCD$ be $s$. </p><p>The longer <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/Diagonal\" title=\"Diagonal\">diagonal</a> of rhombus $BFDE$ is $BD$. Since $BD$ is a side of an equilateral triangle with a side length of $s$, $BD = s$. The longer diagonal of rhombus $ABCD$ is $AC$.

Therefore, the ratio of the <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/Area\" title=\"Area\">area</a> of rhombus $BFDE$ to rhombus $ABCD$ is $\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\right) ^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.</p><p>Let $x$ be the area of rhombus $BFDE$.

        "<p>We can extend line $DE$, meeting line $AB$ at $G$. Similarly, we can extend line $DF$ to meet line $BC$ at $H$. We can see with some simple math that triangle $ADG$ is a $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle, so we can call line $AG$ as $x$, line $DG$ as $x\\sqrt{3}$, and line $AD$ as $2x$ (because of the $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle side proportions). </p><p>We can also see that line $AD$ is a base of rhombus $ABCD$, and line $DH$ is a height. Since triangle $DHC$ is also a $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle, line $DH$ is also $x\\sqrt{3}$. Since the question told us that the area of rhombus $ABCD$ is $24$, we can make the following equation:</p><p>$2x \\cdot x\\sqrt{3} = 24$</p><p>Solving for x:</p><p>$2x^2\\sqrt{3} = 24$</p><p>$x^2\\sqrt{3} = 12$</p><p>$x^2 = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p>$x^2 = 4\\sqrt{3}$</p><p>$x = 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p><br/>Since the question is to find the area of rhombus $BFDE$, to find the answer, we can just multiply base $DE$ with the rhombus's height. We'll start by finding the height: instantly we can see that $GB$ is the height. Since all the sides of a rhombus are equal, and we found earlier that the side length is $2x$, if $AG$ is $x$, that means $GB$ is the same length as $AG$ - that is to say, </p><p>$GB = AG = 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}}$</p><p><br/>Now to find the base.

Because all of them are integers, then we know that $AD$ has to also contain $\\sqrt{101}$ to ensure that $AB*AD$ is an integer. Once you know that, you can guarantee that the answer must be a multiple of 101. (If you're wondering why there can't be a fraction like $1/101$, there can't because $y$ is an integer the number under the square root in $AD$, is an integer.) Having that information narrows down the answer choices to just $(B)$ $4040$, and $(E)$ $40400$.</p><p>Looking back at what we found for $AB$, which is $200\\sqrt{101}$, and what we know about $AD$, that it has to contain $\\sqrt{101}$. we know that the answer is at least $200\\sqrt{101}*\\sqrt{101}=20200$, which is already greater than answer choice $(B)$, which is $4040$. From this, we can conclude that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }  40400}$</p><p>~ @flyingkinder123</p>"

This means that the license plate would have to have two $0$ digits, and would either be of the form $XX00$ or $X0X0$ (X being the other digit in the license plate) . The condition $XX00$ is impossible as Mr. Jones can't be $00$ years old. If we separate the second condition, $X0X0$ into its prime factors, we get $X\\cdot 10\\cdot 101$. $101$ is prime, and therefore can't account for allowing $X0X0$ being evenly divisible by the childrens' ages. The $10$ accounts for the 5 and one factor of 2. This leaves $X$, but no single digit number contains all the prime factors besides 5 and 2 of the childrens' ages, thus $5$ $\\boxed{ B }$ can't be one of the childrens' ages.</p>",
        "<p>Another way to do the problem is by the process of elimination. The only possible correct choices are the highest powers of each prime, $2^3=8$, $3^2=9$, $5^1=5$, and $7^1=7$, since indivisibility by any powers lower than these means indivisibility by a higher power of the prime (for example, indivisibility by $2^2=4$ means indivisibility by $2^3=8)$. Since the number is divisible by $9$, it is not the answer, and the digits have to add up to $9$. Let $(a,b)$ be the digits: since $2\\cdot(a+b) | 9$, $(a+b)|9$. The only possible choices for $(a,b)$ are $(0,9)$, $(1,8)$, $(2,7)$, $(3,6)$, and $(4,5)$. The only number that works is $5544$, but it is not divisible by $5$. $\\boxed{ B }$</p><p>~edited by mobius247</p>",
        "<p>Since 5 has the \"strictest\" divisibility rules of the single digit numbers, we check that case first. To be divisible by 9, the other repeating digit must be 4. Seeing that 5544 is the only arrangement of 2 4's and 2 5's that is divisible by the other single digit numbers and itself is not divisible by 5, the answer is $\\boxed {(B) 5}$.-liu4505~edited by mobius247</p>"
