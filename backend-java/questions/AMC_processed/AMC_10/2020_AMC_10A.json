Then, we can see that from $4$ to $200$, incrementing by $4$, there are $50$ numbers that we have to subtract. To do this we can do $50$ times $51$ divided by $2$, and then we can multiply by $4$, because we are counting by fours, not ones. Our answer will be $5100$, but remember, we have to do this twice.

The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$.

Start by squaring $x + y$, to obtain \\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 16\\]Simplifying, $x^2 + y^2 = 20$. Squaring once more, we obtain \\[x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 = 400\\]Once again simplifying, $x^4 + y^4 = 392$.

Using this, we can make the following Newton sums:\\[P_1 = S_1\\]\\[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2\\]\\[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2\\]\\[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2\\]\\[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2.\\]We also know that $S_1$ is 4 because $x + y$ is four, and we know that $S_2$ is $-2$ because $x \\cdot y$ is $-2$ as well.Then, we can plug in values!

Now all we need to find is $x^5 + y^5$. Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 = 4^5 = 1024$. The extra terms that we don't need is $5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 = 5xy(x^3 + y^3) + 10x^2y^2(x + y) = -10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$. What's $x^3 + y^3$? We use the same method. Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy(x + y) = x^3 + y^3 - 24 = 4^3 = 64$. Now we know that $x^3 + y^3 = 64 + 24 = 88$, and plugging that into $-10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$ gives $-10(88) + 160 = -880 + 160 = -720$. Now we see that those extra terms have a sum of $-720$. Thus $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + y^5 - 720 = 1024$ so $x^5 + y^5 = 1024 + 720 = 1744$. Remember our goal: we want to find $\\frac{-8 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$.

        "<p>Since we start at the top face and end at the bottom face without moving from the lower ring to the upper ring or revisiting a face, our journey must consist of the top face, a series of faces in the upper ring, a series of faces in the lower ring, and the bottom face, in that order.</p><p>We have $5$ choices for which face we visit first on the top ring. From there, we have $9$ choices for how far around the top ring we go before moving down: $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around clockwise, $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around counterclockwise, or immediately going down to the lower ring without visiting any other faces in the upper ring.</p><p>We then have $2$ choices for which lower ring face to visit first (since every upper-ring face is adjacent to exactly $2$ lower-ring faces) and then once again $9$ choices for how to travel around the lower ring.

        "<p>There are five ways to get to the top ring. Casework:</p><p>Case 1: directly go to bottom ringFor each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we have two ways of directly going to the bottom ring, as each face on the top is adjacent to two faces on the bottom. There are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ paths here.</p><p>Case 2: traversing sidewaysAfter entering the top ring, we can also choose to travel sideways along the top ring before going to the bottom ring. For each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we can choose 2 directions to go (clockwise or counterclockwise). Once we choose a direction, we can go 1, 2, 3, or 4 faces in that direction. Notice we cannot travel 5 faces because then we would land on the original top ring face, but the problem specifies that we can only travel each face once. Once again, top ring faces are each adjacent to two bottom ring faces, so after traversing sideways we can choose 2 paths to exit. There are $5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 80$ paths here.</p><p>Adding the two cases together, there are 90 ways to get to the bottom ring from the top.</p><p>Next, from the bottom ring to the bottom we do casework again:</p><p>Case 1: directly go to the bottomFor each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there is only 1 way to get to the bottom. So there are 90 ways here.</p><p>Case 2: traversing sidewaysFor each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there are once again 2 ways to choose the direction and 4 ways to choose the amount of faces traveled. However, after traveling the faces there is only 1 way to go to the bottom face. There are $90 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 720$ paths here.</p><p>Adding together the cases, there are 810 paths, or answer choice E.~JH. L</p>",
        "<p>Like Solution 3, we can use casework, but in a different way. We can split the caseworks into the amount of moves we spend on each row (top and bottom, where both rows have 5 faces).</p><p>Case 1: 1 move on the top row;There are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row from the starting point (just moving on each of the five faces). Now we want to look at how many ways we can move towards the bottom. Notice how we have two faces on the bottom row that are adjacent to each of the top faces. If we spend one move on the bottom, there are 2 ways. If we spend two moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways (since order matters, we can flip the direction of these moves). If we spend three moves on the bottom, there are also 4 ways (similar reasoning). If we spend four moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways. And if we spend five moves on the bottom, there are again, 4 ways. In total there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18$ ways to move from the bottom after the top moves are chosen. And since there are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row, there are $5 \\cdot 18 = 90$ ways.</p><p>Case 2: 2 moves on the top row;From just counting, we can see that there are five ways to move once on the top, and after that, two options for the second move (either left or right), so there are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ ways. And from using what we obtained in Case 1, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case.</p><p>Case 3: three moves on the top row;There are, again, 10 ways to do this. And so, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case to happen.</p><p>Now, we can see that there will be 10 ways for the remaining cases of the first move for the top row (because 5 ways to choose the first, and then you can go either left or right, so $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$).So for Case 4 and Case 5, there will both also be $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways.</p><p>Finally, adding all these cases up, we obtain $90 + 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 810$, or $\\boxed{(E)}$~Misclicked</p>"

This implies that $n$ does not divide either $998, 999$ or $1000$, meaning that when divided by $n$, none of the quotients are whole. In turn, this also means that they will all have the same whole number part. </p><p><br/>If $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ were to have a different whole number part, then $n$ would have to lie within $998$ and $1000$. If this is confusing, think of why $\\frac{6}{5}, \\frac{7}{5}$ and $\\frac{8}{5}$ have the same whole number part ($1$ in this case). Here, $n=5$. What happens to the whole number part when $n=7$? </p><p><br/>Since $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ have identical whole number parts, their floors are identical, since the floor of a number is equal to its whole number part, discarding its fractional component. </p><p><br/>Let $k$ be the number we get when we floor $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ or $\\frac{1000}{n}$ if the three of those numbers lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$. Adding them up, we get $3k$ (due to their floors being the same), which is a mulutiple of $3$. So no matter what, we cannot have $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$. </p><p><br/>What does this mean? It means that there must be some multiple of $n$ within this expression (with some restrictions, as we'll see), in order to prevent the violation of the main restriction. We can proceed with casework now.</p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 1}$</p><p><br/>Let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{998}{n}$. Luckily, the only prime factors of $998$ are $2$ and $499$. </p><p><br/>We can observe that $499$ doesn't work, since $\\frac{998}{499}$ and $\\frac{1000}{499}$ will both round down to $2$ when divided by it. However, $2$ does work, since it divides both $998$ and $1000$. The floor of $\\frac{999}{2}$ is $499$, , meaning that when we evaluate the given expression for $n=2$, we will get $2\\cdot{499}+500$ which isn't a multiple of $3$. </p><p><br/>This case works because we have a multiple of $n$ at the end of the expression, as well as the beginning, so the whole number parts of $998, 999$ and $1000$ when divided by $n$ are not all the same, due to $n$ dividing two of these numbers. </p><p>The restriction of $n$ dividing more than one number within the expression is only valid when we're testing the first number in the given expression (otherwise, the other floors wouldn't round down to the same value as the first). </p><p>Case $1$ is complete, and we've found that only $2$ works. </p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 2}$</p><p>Now, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{999}{n}$. In this case, if $n$ divides $999$, it doesn't divide $998$ (since two multiples of a number greater than $1$ are never consecutive), nor does it divide $1000$, for the same reason. </p><p><br/>The prime factorization of $999$ is $3^3\\cdot37$, and thus has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ divisors. </p><p><br/>When testing a few values of $n$ initially, we observed that $n=1$ causes the expression to be divisible by $3$. Subtracting $1$, we see that there are $7$ values of $n$ that work for this case.</p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Case 3}$</p><p>Finally, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{1000}{n}.$</p><p><br/>Our goal is to have the other multiple of $n$ below whatever $\\frac{998}{n}$ is, so we won't have identical floors throughout the expression. </p><p><br/>Once again, any factor of $1000$, except for $2$ is relatively prime to both $998$ and $999$, so when we floor those two numbers, we get an integer that isn't $500$. </p><p><br/>$1000$ factors as $2^3\\cdot{5^3}$, meaning that it has $(3+1)(3+1)=16$ divisors. $1$ and $2$ either don't work or have already been counted, so there are $14$ valid values of $n$ for this case. </p><p><br/>$\\textbf{Ending}$</p><p><br/>Adding these three cases, we get $1+7+14= \\boxed{\\textbf{A) }22}$ values of $n$.</p><p>-Benedict T (countmath1)</p>",

Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$'s final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.</p><p>Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.</p><p>Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",
        "<p>As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation.</p><p>Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$, $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$, and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$, just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ($0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$. This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways.</p><p>Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$, which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways.</p><p>$6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$.</p>",
        "<p>Define $s$ as a reflection, and $r$ as a $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation. Thus, $r^4=s^2=e$, and the five transformations can be represented as ${r, r^2, r^3, r^2s, s}$, and $rs=sr^{-1}$.</p><p>Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total.</p><p>For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$, else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$, which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$. A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$). This gives $6$ ways.</p><p>Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$.</p><p>~Xrider100</p>"

Since, $n>1000$, we can do some bounding and get that $k > 53$ and $\\ell > 17$.

It follows that $y$ must be odd, since the GCD will be $120$ instead of $60$ if $y$ is even. Also, the unit digit of $n$ must be $7$, since the unit digit of $60y$ is always $0$ and the unit digit of $57$ is $7$.

        "<p>First, we find $n$. We know that it is greater than $1000$, so we first input $n = 1000$. From the first equation, $\\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$, we know that if $n$ is correct, after we add $120$ to it, it should be divisible by $21$, but not $63$: \\[\\frac{n + 120}{21} = \\frac{1120}{21} = 53\\text{ R }7.\\]This does not work. To get to the nearest number divisible by $21$, we have to add $14$ to cancel out the remainder. (Note that we don't subtract $7$ to get to $53$; $n$ is already at its lowest possible value!)Adding $14$ to $1000$ gives us $n = 1014$.

This requires some guessing and checking. We can add $21$ over and over again until $n$ is valid. This changes $n$ while also maintaining that $\\frac{n + 120}{21}$ has no remainders. After adding $21$ once, we get $18 r 18$. By pure luck, adding $21$ two more times gives us $19$ with no remainders. We now have $1077 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 1140$. However, this number is divisible by $120$. To get the next possible number, we add the LCM of $21$ and $60$ (once again, to maintain divisibility), which is $420$. Unfortunately, $1140 + 420 = 1560$ is still divisible by $120$. Adding $420$ again gives us $1980$, which is valid.

        "<p>We count the numerator.Jason will pick up no dice if he already has a $7$ as a sum. We need to assume he does not have a $7$ to begin with.If Jason decides to pick up all the dice to re-roll, by the stars and bars rule ways to distribute, ${n+k-1 \\choose k-1}$, there will be $2$ bars and $4$ stars ($3$ of them need to be guaranteed because a roll is at least $1$) for a probability of $\\frac{15}{216}=\\frac{2.5}{36}$.If Jason picks up $2$ dice and leaves a die showing $k$, he will need the other two to sum to $7-k$. This happens with probability \\[\\frac{6-k}{36}\\] for integers $1 \\leq k \\leq 6$.If the roll is not $7$, Jason will pick up exactly one die to re-roll if there can remain two other dice with sum less than $7$, since this will give him a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance which is a larger probability than all the cases unless he has a $7$ to begin with.We have \\[\\frac{1}{6} > \\underline{\\frac{5,4,3}{36}} > \\frac{2.5}{36} > \\frac{2,1,0}{36}.\\]We count the underlined part's frequency for the numerator without upsetting the probability greater than it.Let $a$ be the roll we keep. We know $a\\leq3$ since $a=4$ would cause Jason to pick up all the dice.When $a=1$, there are $3$ choices for whether it is rolled $1$st, $2$nd, or $3$rd, and in this case the other two rolls have to be at least $6$ (or he would have only picked up $1$). This give $3 \\cdot 1^{2} =3$ ways.Similarly, $a=2$ gives $3 \\cdot 2^{2} =12$ because the $2$ can be rolled in $3$ places and the other two rolls are at least $5$.$a=3$ gives $3 \\cdot 3^{2} =27$.

Since in this case, every dice's initial outcome is $4$, $5$ or $6$, this value is $1$, $2$ or $3$. By basic dice probability, the probability that they add to one is $0$; the probability that they add to two is $\\frac{1}{36}$; the probability that they add to three is $\\frac{1}{18}$. Each of these probabilities is less than $\\frac{5}{72}$, (the probability of winning by rerolling everything) so Jason should not reroll one dice in this scenario.

Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$, this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$.</p><p><b>Proof of only-if part</b>: If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$. Also, if the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$, the total initial sum must also be greater than $7$, so Jason should not reroll zero dice.</p><p>From having shown these two claims, we know that Jason should reroll two dice if at least one of them is a $1$, $2$ or $3$, and if the sum of any two of the initial dice is at least $7$. We can write out all the possibilities of initial rolls, account for their permutations, and add everything together to see that there are $42$ total outcomes, where Jason should reroll two dice.
