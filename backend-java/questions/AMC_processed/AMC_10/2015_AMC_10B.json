Otherwise, he walks one unit straight ahead to reach $p_{n+1}$. Thus the sequence of points continues $p_2=(1,1), p_3=(0,1), p_4=(-1,1), p_5=(-1,0)$, and so on in a counterclockwise spiral pattern.

On the $24$th step, he is on the bottom right corner of the $5\\times 5$ square centered at the origin. It seems that the $p_{n^2-1}$ is the bottom right corner of the $n\\times n$ square. This makes sense since, after $n^2-1$, he has been on $n^2$ dots, including the point $p_0$. Also, this is only for odd $n$, because starting with the $1\\times 1$ square, we can only add one extra set of dots to each side, so we cannot get even $n$. Since $45^2=2025$, $p_{2024}$ is the bottom right corner of the $45\\times 45$ square. This point is $\\frac{45-1}{2}=22$ over to the right, and therefore $22$ down, so $p_{2024}=(22, -22)$.
