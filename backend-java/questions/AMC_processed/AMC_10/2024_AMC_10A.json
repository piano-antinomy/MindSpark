Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for $n$, where itself and $n+1$ are factors of $720$. From here, we can check whether $n(n+1) = 720$ yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of $720$, which is $360$. $n(n+1) = 360$, this doesn't have an integer root either. So, then we check the next biggest factor which is $240$, $n(n+1) = 240$, which we get $15$ as a root. This means the common ration is $\\dfrac{16}{15}$. We then multiply $\\dfrac{16}{15}$ times $720$ and add up the digits getting $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 21}$.</p><p>~yuvag</p>",

This means that $720(\\frac{x}{y})$ and $720(\\frac{y}{x})$ must both be integers, therefore $x$ and $y$ are both factors of $720$. We would achieve the smallest ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$ if $x$ and $y$ are consecutive, so by listing out the factors of $720$, we find that $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, $15$, $16$ are the only consecutive factors (any factors larger than these would result in the ratio simplifying, making it larger than just using consecutive integers). $15$ and $16$ are the largest, so we find the common ratio to be $\\frac{16}{15}$, making $b=720(\\frac{16}{15})$ giving us $768$.

This means that there will be $2024/10$ or $202R4$ whole loops in the subset $S,$ implying that there will be $202*3 = 606$ elements in S. However, we have undercounted, as we did not count the remainder that resulted from $2024/10$$.$ With a remainder of $4,$ we can fit $2$ more elements into the subset $S,$ namely $2021$ and $2024,$ resulting in a total of $606+2$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }608}$ elements in subset $S$.</p><p><br/>NOTE:</p><p>To prove that this is the best we can do, consider adding each element one by one, for the first element, say n.

Because every element in $Q$ is 4 below the elements of $S$, choosing 2 in $Q$ would mean choosing 6 in set $S$. By induction we see that our list would be {2,6,10,14,18,.....2022} which only gives 506 elements which is sub-optimal.
