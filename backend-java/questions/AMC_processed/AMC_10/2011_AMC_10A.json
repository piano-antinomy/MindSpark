Now, in 2011, with an increase of another 150 people, the population is once again a perfect square. Which of the following is closest to the percent growth of the town's population during this twenty-year period?</p>",

        "<p>Let the population of the town in $1991$ be $p^2$. Let the population in $2001$ be $q^2+9$. It follows that $p^2+150=q^2+9$. Rearrange this equation to get $141=q^2-p^2=(q-p)(q+p)$. Since $q$ and $p$ are both positive integers with $q>p$, $(q-p)$ and $(q+p)$ also must be, and thus, they are both factors of $141$. We have two choices for pairs of factors of $141$: $1$ and $141$, and $3$ and $47$. Assuming the former pair, since $(q-p)$ must be less than $(q+p)$, $q-p=1$ and $q+p=141$. Solve to get $p=70, q=71$. Since $p^2+300$ is not a perfect square, this is not the correct pair. Solve for the other pair to get $p=22, q=25$. This time, $p^2+300=22^2+300=784=28^2$. This is the correct pair. Now, we find the percent increase from $22^2=484$ to $28^2=784$. Since the increase is $300$, the percent increase is $\\frac{300}{484}\\times100\\%\\approx\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 62\\%}$.</p>",
        "<p>Proceed through the difference of squares for $p$ and $q$:$141=q^2-p^2=(q-p)(q+p)$</p><p>However, instead of testing both pairs of factors we take a more certain approach.

Then go through the same routine as demonstrated above to finish this problem. </p><p>Note that this approach might take more testing if one is not familiar with finding factors.</p>",

Thus, the answer is $784/484-1\\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 62\\%}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let the population of the town in 1991 be $a^2$ and the population in 2011 be $b^2$. We know that $a^2+150+150=b^2 \\implies a^2-b^2=-300 \\implies b^2-a^2=300 \\implies (b-a)(b+a)=300$. Note that $b-a$ must be even. Testing, we see that $a=22$ and $b=28$ works, as $484+150-9=625=25^2$, so $\\frac{784-484}{484} \\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 62\\%}$.</p><p>~MrThinker</p>"

        "<p>There are $6$ ways to assign a color to $A$. WLOG, give vertex $A$ a color; we can multiply by $6$ at the end.

Using this same logic, there are $5$ ways to assign a color to vertices $E$, $B$, and $D$, giving a total of $5^4=625$ ways. However, vertex $D$ cannot be the same color as vertex $A$. To use complementary counting, we need to find the amount of ways for $D$ and $A$ to have the same color.

        "<p>This problem is a direct application of the chromatic polynomial of a graph, represented by $P_k(G)$, which returns a polynomial representing the number of ways to color a graph $G$ with $k$ colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In other words, it gives us a polynomial in terms of $k$ where we can plug in $k=6$ to get our answer.  </p><p>Well, if we want to find $P_k$ for a graph $G$, we should probably first draw the graph, right? We can first draw five vertices (without any edges) in the shape of a pentagon. After connecting the diagonals, we get a star. We attempt to shift the vertices around to simplify the graph, which we quickly realize is isomorphic (can be turned into) the five-cycle, or the pentagon.  </p><p>Finding $P_k$ on a graph with a cycle of length at most 3 is straightforward -- we first pick a vertex v. It has 0 colored (visited) neighbors, so we can color it in k ways. We then move on to the vertices adjacent to v, etc, and at the end we multiply all these together. For example, the chromatic polynomial of a triangle is $k(k-1)(k-2)$. However, cycles with length > 3 introduce ambiguity, and thus the above technique fails. Thus, we need to use the recursive formula $P_k(G) = P_k(G-e)-P_k(G*e)$, where $G-e$ represents removing e and $G*e$ represents contracting e, or collapsing the two endpoints of e into one. When we hit a graph where the longest cycle has length 3, we can use the first technique to quickly find $P_k$. </p><p>After about four iterations of the algorithm, we get that the chromatic polynomial is $k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3 + k(k-1)(k-2)$.

Then, $R$ has vertices: \\[(0,0), (60,0), (60,60), (0,60).\\]</p><p>Now, let a point in the square have coordinates $(x, y).$</p><p>In order for the point to be $100-$ ray partitional, we must be able to make $100$ triangles with area $60^2/100 = 36.$ For it to not be $60$-ray partitional, we cannot make $60$ triangles with area $60^2/60 = 60.$</p><p>When we draw such a triangle, it's base will always be on one of the sides of the square. If it is on the bottom side, then the height must be $y$. So, the base of each triangle must be $\\frac{72}{y}.$ So, there will be $\\frac{60}{\\frac{72}{y}} = \\frac{60y}{72}$ total triangles on that side.</p><p>If the triangle is on the right side of the square, then the height has to be $60 - x.$ So, the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-x}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-x)}{72}$ triangles.</p><p>If the triangle is on the top, the height will be $60-y$, the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-y}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-y)}{72}$ triangles along this side.</p><p>The triangles on the left will have height $x$, base $\\frac{72}{x}$ and $\\frac{60x}{72}$ such triangles must exist. </p><p>Simplifying, we get $\\frac{5y}{6}, \\frac{5 (60-x)}{6}, \\frac{5(60-y)}{6}, \\frac{5x}{6}$ triangles on the respective sides of the square. </p><p>All of these numbers must be integers. Let $x = 60a$ and $y = 60b$ where $0 < a, b < 1.$</p><p><br/>Then, the amounts become: \\[50a, 50b,  50 - 50a, 50 - 50b.\\]</p><p>As long as $50a$ and $50b$ are integers, $50 - 50a$ and $50 - 50b$ will also be integers. </p><p>For this to happen, $a$ and $b$ must be of the form $\\frac{x}{50}$ where $1 \\le x \\le 49.$ So, we have a total of $49^2 = 2401$ points that are $100$-ray partitional. </p><p>Now, we must calculate the number of $100$- ray partitional points that are also $60$-ray partitional. </p><p>Using a method similar to before, if a point is $60$-ray partitional, then we must be able to make $30a, 30b, 30 - 30a, 30 -30b$ triangles on the different sides. </p><p>So, $30a$ and $30b$ must be integers. This means $a$ and $b$ have to be of the form $\\frac{y}{30}$ where $0<y<30.$</p><p>If a point is both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional, then it can be written as \\[\\frac{x}{50} =  \\frac{y}{30}\\]. Note that whenever $x$ is divisible by $5$, a $y$ will always exist to satisfy the above equation.</p><p>So, $x$ has to be in the range $(0, 50)$ and must be divisible by $5$. There are $9$ possibilities, namely $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.$</p><p>The $x$-coordinate of the point and the $y$-coordinate of the point can each use any of these $9$ possibilities, giving $9^2 = 81$ numbers that are both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional.</p><p>Overall, we are left with $2401 - 81 = \\boxed{2320}$ solutions.</p>",
        "<p>If $X$ is $100-ray$ partitional, and there are $n$ triangles on a side, then the total area of those $n$ triangles will be $\\frac{n}{100}$. Since the side has length $1$, then the length of the altitude from $X$ to that side will be $\\frac{n}{50}$.</p><p><br/>There will be 1 unique way to split this side into bases of triangles with height $\\frac{n}{50}$, and also 1 unique split into triangles on the opposite side. Since $n$ can range from $[1,49]$, there will be $49$ different distances from $1$ side, and $49$ different distances from an adjacent side, for a total of $49\\cdot 49 = 2401$ $100-ray$ partitional points. </p><p><br/>Similarly, for a point to be $60-ray$ partitional, the distance from the sides should be of the form $\\frac{k}{30}$. For this point to also be $100-ray$ partitional, it must also be of the form $\\frac{z}{50}$. Clearly, the only possible values of $k$ are $(3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27)$ for a total of 9 ways, so there are $9\\cdot 9 = 81$ points that are $60-ray$ partitional and $100-ray$ partitional.</p><p><br/>Subtracting $81$ from $2401$, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2320}$. </p><p>-skibbysiggy</p>"
