So the answer is 8. It can be done even if one does not remember that 45 squared is 2025, all it takes is intuition. One can easily see mentally that 5 x 8 that is 40 squared is 1600, and then one has to do just one more computation and see that 5 x 9 that is 45 squared exceeds 2023, so the answer is 8. </p><p>~edit by RobinDaBank</p><p>Note that you can find the square of any number that ends in 5 by taking the number 5 more than it and the number 5 less than it, multiplying those together, and adding 25.

So, we can factor $P(x)$ as $x(x - 9)(x - 4)(x - a)$, where $a$ is the unknown root. Since $P(x) - 1 = 0$, we plug in $x = 1$ which gives $1(-8)(-3)(1 - a) = 1$, so $24(1 - a) = 1 \\implies 1 - a = 1/24 \\implies a = 23/24$.

        "<p>We proceed similarly to solution one. We get that $x(x-9)(x-4)(x-a)=1$. Expanding, we get that $x(x-9)(x-4)(x-a)=x^4-(a+13)x^3+(13a+36)x^2-36ax$. We know that $P(1)=1$, so the sum of the coefficients of the cubic expression is equal to one. Thus $1-(a+13)+(13a+36)-36a=1$. Solving for $a$, we get that $a = 23/24$.
