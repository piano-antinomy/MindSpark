Then the sum of the terms in this sequence is $aN + \\frac{(N-1)(N)}{2}=45$. Rearranging and factoring, this reduces to $N(2a+N-1) = 90$. Since $N$ must divide $90$, and we know that $90$ is an attainable value of the sum, $90$ must be the maximum.</p>",

        "<p>The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$. After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$, so the inradius is $4$. Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$. Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$. The distance $OA$ is $6$, because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$, because it is the radius of the incircle.

        "<p>The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$. The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$. The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$. The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$, while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$. After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$, so the inradius is $4$. Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$. Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$. The distance $OA$ is $6$, because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$, because it is the radius of the incircle.

        "<p>Think of a turn as adding a block or an interval of numbers to each person. Here are the first couple \"blocks\" that Tadd has (a block will be denoted in interval notation): [$1$], [$7$-$10$], [$22$-$28$], [$46$-$55$]. From simple inspection, we can notice two things.</p><p>$1$) The start points of each interval is increasing arithmetically by $9$.</p><p>$2$) The length of each \"block\" is increasing by $3$. </p><p>Since each block length is increasing by 3, then we want $1$+$4$+$7$+..$3n-2$ = $2019$ or $n(3n-1)/2 = 2019$, where $n$ is the amount of blocks we have. In a short amount of time, you will see that $n$ is not an integer from that equation, but thats perfectly okay since we can just find an $n$ that gets it close to 2019, then we can work from there. From inspection, you will see that a good n value that does that exact job is $37$. </p><p>We can then deduce that the start point of the $37$th block will be $1+(6+15+24..+321) = 5887$ if we refer to fact $1$. We can easily find the length of 37th block by $36*3+1 = 109$ if we refer to fact $2$. Remember that the length increases by $3$ for each block. So we then can deduce that our endpoint for the 37th block is $5887+109-1 = 5995$. The endpoint of the $37$th block will be the $2035$th number said because we can plug $37$ into $n(3n-1)/2$, which tells us how many numbers Tadd has said where $n$ is the number of blocks Tadd has. From there we know that the $2019$th number is in $37$th block, so that means we can take our endpoint and subtract $2035-2019 = 16$ from the endpoint of the $37$th block, which is $5995$, so we get $5995-16 = 5979$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$.~~triggod</p>"

Further experimentation finds that $n=4$ does not work as there are 11 factors of 2 in the numerator and 12 in the denominator.
