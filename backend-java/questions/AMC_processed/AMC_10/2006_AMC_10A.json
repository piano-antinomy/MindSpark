Arrangement $II$ allows $32\\pi$ square feet plus a little more on the top part of the fence. So we already know that Arrangement $II$ allows more freedom - only thing left is to find out how much.

After an odd number of steps, the possible points that can be reached are $B$,$D$,$G$,$E$. Then, for even-numbered steps, the remaining points can be reached. Since he has taken seven steps, the end point must be one of the points in $B$,$D$,$G$,$E$. At this point, we classify and discuss the movement trajectory of the bug. </p><p>Case 1: It moves to another plane after completing one plane. If it starts on the upper plane, there are two possibilities for the first step, $B$ or $D$. The second and third steps are restricted to the upper plane, and the fourth step will move to the nearby point on another plane. These three steps have only one possibility each, so there is no need for classification. Then, when it reaches the lower plane, the fifth step has two possibilities, thus limiting the sixth and seventh steps as well. Proceeding in this way, the bug can also move from left to right or from front to back. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ situations. </p><p>Case 2: Opposite to case 1, it can directly pass through to another point G on the other diagonal of the cube within the first three steps. There are three choices for the first step, two choices for the second step, and only one choice for the third step. Therefore, there are $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ situations for the first three steps. The subsequent steps will be restricted to a single path (try it yourself). </p><p>In summary, there are 12 + 6 = 18 situations in total. Therefore, the final probability is 18/2187 = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac2{243}}$.</p><p>~ A mystery eastern egg (wtng)</p>"
