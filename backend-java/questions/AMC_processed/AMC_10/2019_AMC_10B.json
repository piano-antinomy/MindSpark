        "<p>We can clearly deduce that $70\\%$ of the non-seniors do play an instrument, but, since the total percentage of instrument players is $46.8\\%$, the non-senior population is quite low.

Then the two lines we get are: \\[x+2y=3\\] \\[x+3y=5\\]Use elimination to deduce \\[y = 2\\] and plug this into one of the previous line equations. We get \\[x+4 = 3 \\Rightarrow x=-1\\] Thus the common point is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (-1,2)}$.</p><p>~IronicNinja</p>",
        "<p>We know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ form an arithmetic progression, so if the common difference is $d$, we can say $a,b,c = a, a+d, a+2d.$ Now we have $ax+ (a+d)y = a+2d$, and expanding gives $ax + ay + dy = a + 2d.$ Factoring gives $a(x+y-1)+d(y-2) = 0$. Since this must always be true (regardless of the values of $a$ and $d$), we must have $x+y-1 = 0$ and $y-2 = 0$, so $x,y = -1, 2,$ and the common point is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (-1,2)}$.</p>",
        "<p>We use process of elimination. $\\textbf{B}$ doesn't necessarily work because $b = c$ isn't always true. $\\textbf{C, D, E}$ also doesn't necessarily work because the x-value is $1$, but the y-value is an integer. So by process of elimination, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (-1, 2)}$ is our answer.  ~Baolan</p>",
        "<p>We know that in $ax + by = c$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are in an arithmetic progression. We can simplify any arithmetic progression to be $0$, $1$, $2$, and $-1$, $0$, $1$.</p><p>For example, the progression $2$, $4$, $6$ can be rewritten as $0$, $2$, $4$ by going back by one value. We can then divide all 3 numbers by 2 which gives us $0$, $1$, $2$.</p><p>Now, we substitute $a$, $b$, and $c$ with $0$, $1$, $2$, and $-1$, $0$, $1$ respectively. This gives us</p><p>$y = 2$ and $-x = 1$ which can be written as $x = -1$. The only point of intersection is $(-1,2)$. So, our answer is</p><p>$\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (-1, 2)}$.~Starshooter11</p>",
        "<p>Since the problem doesn't specify any further conditions other than an arithmetic sequence (i.e., that the numbers have to be increasing, or positive or something like that) we choose the sequences $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(1, 0, -1)$ which correspond to the equations $0x+y=2$ and $1x+0y=-1$. These just simplify to $x=-1$ and $y=2$, so the coordinate is $(-1, 2)$.</p><p>~JH. L</p>"

More formally, we can say that area is <i>invariant</i> under reflection.</p><p>$\\textbf{(C)}$: If point $A$ has coordinates $(p,q)$, then $A'$ will have coordinates $(q,p)$.

To prove: if point $A$ has coordinates $(p,q)$ and point $B$ has coordinates $(r,s)$, then $A'$ and $B'$ will, respectively, have coordinates $(q,p)$ and $(s,r)$. The product of the gradients of $AB$ and $A'B'$ is $\\frac{s-q}{r-p} \\cdot \\frac{r-p}{s-q} = 1 \\neq -1$, so in fact these lines are <b>never</b> perpendicular to each other (using the \"negative reciprocal\" condition for perpendicularity).</p><p>Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}}$.</p>"

        "<p>We notice that the square can be split into $4$ congruent smaller squares, with the altitude of the equilateral triangle being the side of this smaller square.

        "<p>We can see that the side length of the square is $2\\sqrt{3}$ by considering the altitude of the equilateral triangle as in Solution 1. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the diagonal of the square is thus $\\sqrt{12+12}=\\sqrt{24}=2\\sqrt{6}$. Because of this, the height of one of the four shaded kites is $\\sqrt{6}$. Now, we just need to find the length of that kite. By the Pythagorean Theorem again, this length is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} - 2}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3} - 1 = \\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}$. Now using $\\text{area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{length} \\cdot \\text{width}$, the area of one of the four kites is $2 \\sqrt{6} \\times \\left(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}\\right) = 12 - 2\\sqrt{12} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 12 - 4\\sqrt{3}}$.</p>",

        "<p>From the previous solutions, we know that the side length of the square is $2\\sqrt{3}$, which means that the area of the square is $(2\\sqrt{3})^2 = 12$. Since the side lengths of the equilateral triangles are integers and not expressions containing an integer and a radical, we know that the combined areas of the triangles will be in the form $x\\sqrt{3}$.

        "<p>Draw the two diagonals of the square.

Then, since we cannot have two consecutive $0$s, it must end in a $10$. Now, we only have two cases: it ends with $010$, or it ends with $110$ which is equivalent to $0110$. Thus, our sequence must be of the forms $0\\ldots010$ or $0\\ldots0110$. In the first case, the first $n-2$ digits are equivalent to a valid sequence of length $n-2$. In the second, the first $n-3$ digits are equivalent to a valid sequence of length $n-3$.

        "<p>Any valid sequence must start with a $0$. We can then think of constructing a sequence as adding groups of terms to this $0$, each ending in $0$. (This is always possible because every valid string ends in $0$.) For example, we can represent the string $01011010110110$ as: $0-10-110-10-110-110$.To not have any consecutive 0s, we must have at least one $1$ before the next $0$. However, we cannot have three or more $1$s before the next $0$ because we cannot have three consecutive $1$s. Consequently, we can only have one or two $1$s. </p><p>So we can have the groups: $10$ and $110$.</p><p>After the initial $0$, we have $18$ digits left to fill in the string. Let the number of $10$ blocks be $x$, and $110$ be $y$. Then $x$ and $y$ must satisfy $2x+3y=18$. We recognize this as a Diophantine equation. Taking $\\pmod{2}$ yields $y=0 \\pmod{2}$.
