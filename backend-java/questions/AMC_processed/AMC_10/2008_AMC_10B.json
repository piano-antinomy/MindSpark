        "<p>This solution might be time consuming, but it is pretty rigorous. Also, throughout the solution refer to the graph in solution 1 to understand this one more. Lets first start off by defining the position function for Michael. We let $M(t) = 5t$, where $t$ is the amount of seconds passed. Now, lets define the position function of the truck as two independent functions. It is obvious, graphically, that the position function of the truck is a piecewise function alternating between linear lines and constant lines. Lets focus on the linear pieces of the truck's position function. Let the $kth$ linear part of the truck's position function be denoted as $L_k(t)$. Then through algebra, it is found that $L_k(t) = 10t +  500 - 300k$, ${50k - 50 <= t <= 50k - 30}$. Now, lets move on to the constant pieces, which is a lot easier in terms of algebra. Let the $ith$ constant part of the truck's position function be denoted as $C_i(t)$. Then, again, through algebra we obtain $C_i(t) = 200 * (i + 1)$, ${50i - 30 <= t <= 50i}$. Now, let me stress that $i$ and $k$ are disjoint, which is why I used different variable names. We are interested in where $C_i(t)$ and $L_k(t)$ intersect $M(t)$ or $5t$. $L_k(t)$ intersects $M$ at $(60k - 100, 300k - 500)$. However, the only $k$ values that actually work are $5 <= k <= 7$ because of the domain restrictions on $L_k(t)$. Similarly, we also see that for $C_i(t)$ it intersects at $(40i + 40, 200i + 200)$. The only $i$ values that work is $4 <= i <= 7$. However, some pair $(i, k)$ might yield the same exact intersection point. Checking this through simple algebra we see that $(4,5)$ and $(7,7)$ do indeed yield the same intersection point. Thus, our answer is $(7 - 5 + 1) + (7 - 4 + 1) - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.</p><p>Note: This is probably not the best solution as it seems a lot more tedious, but it still works.
