The area of the rectangle is $4*2=8$ and the area of the 90 degrees partial circles are $2*(1/4)*\\pi*2^2 = 2\\pi$.

We can find the height of the remaining portion of the cube by finding the height of the tetrahedron. We can find the height of this tetrahedron in perspective to the equilateral triangle base (we call this height $x$) by finding the volume of the tetrahedron in two ways. $\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2}$ is the area of the isosceles base of the tetrahedron. Multiply by the height, $1$, and divide by $3$, we have the volume of the tetrahedron as $\\frac{1}{6}$. We set this area equal to one-third the product of our desired height and the area of the equilateral triangle base. First, find the area of the equilateral triangle: $[BCD]=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}^2 \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

The coordinate of corner C is $(0,0,0)$, $E(1,0,1)$, $B(0,1,1)$, and $H(1,1,0)$. Since we are trying to figure out the height of the object, we have to determine which corner is the farthest away from the cut surface. It is corner $H$, and the height of the object is the distance between the center of mass of the cut surface and corner $H$. The center of mass of the cut surface is $G(1/3, 1/3, 2/3)$. Using the distance between two points formula, the height of the object $\\sqrt{(1-\\frac{1}{3})^{2}+(1-\\frac{1}{3})^{2}+(0-\\frac{2}{3})^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{12}{9}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

We can label $E$ as $(0, 0, 0)$, $F$ as $(1, 0, 0)$, $B$ as $(0, 1, 0)$, and $G$ as $(0, 0, 1)$.

If the bug passes through the white arrow, the red arrow that the bug travels through must be the closest to the first black arrow. Otherwise, the bug will have to travel through both red segments, which is impossible because now there is no path to take after the bug emerges from the reverse arrow. Similarly, with the blue segments, the second black arrow taken must be the one that is closest to the blue arrow that was taken. Also, it is trivial that the two black arrows taken must be different. Therefore, if the reverse arrow is taken, the blue arrow taken determines the entire path and there is $1$ path for every arrow. Since the bug cannot return once it takes a blue arrow, the answer must be divisible by $5$. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2400}$ is the only answer that is.</p>",
