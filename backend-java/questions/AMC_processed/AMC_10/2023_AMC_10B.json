She fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. What fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>The first three glasses each have a full glass. Let's assume that each glass has \"1 unit\" of juice. It won't matter exactly how much juice everyone has because we're dealing with ratios, and that wouldn't affect our answer. The fourth glass has a glass that is one third. So the total amount of juice will be $1+1+1+\\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{10}{3}$. If we divide the total amount of juice by 4, we get $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, which should be the amount of juice in each glass. This means that each of the first three glasses will have to contribute $1 - \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac16}.$ to the fourth glass.</p><p>~Sir Ian Seo the Great &amp; lprado</p>",

Pouring $\\frac{1}{6}$ from each of the first three glasses will make them all $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ full. Thus, all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.

        "<p>Suppose the numbers are $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$. First, we try to calculate the amount of ways for all three balls to be placed in a bin so the number of balls in each bin is odd. $a_1+a_2+a_3=2023$ and each bin has at least one ball because they are positive odd numbers. Changing the equation, we see that $\\frac{[(a_1)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_2)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_3)+1]}{2}=\\frac{(2023+3)}{2}$. Let $a_1+1=2b_1$, $a_2+1=2b_2$, and $a_3+1=2b_3$. Thus $b_1+b_2+b_3=1013$. We can also see that $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ are all positive. Using the positive version of stars and bars, we get ${1013-1 \\choose 3-1}$ = ${1012 \\choose 2}$ choices. </p><p>Now, we want to find the total amount of cases.

Cancelling the twos, we get $\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011}{2025 \\cdot 2024}$. This is roughly equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\frac{1}{4}}$.</p><p>~Aopsthedude</p>",

Similarly, the area of $\\triangle UFK$ is half that of $\\triangle PFK$. Thus:</p><p><br/>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(5 \\cdot[DKT]-5 \\cdot [PFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK])\\]</p><p>We also know that since we dropped an altitude from $O$ to $U$, the area of $\\triangle ODU$ must be half of a fifth of the total area of the pentagon. Therefore we can rewrite the above equation as \\[[FGHIJ]=10 \\cdot ([ODU]-[DVT]+[UFK])\\]</p><p>Now notice that $\\triangle ODU  ~ \\triangle TDV ~ \\triangle KFU$ by AA similarity. Therefore, if we can write the areas of the latter two triangles as a ratio of the first triangle, we can express the whole equation in terms of $[ODU]$, and by extension $[ABCDE]$, which we know. To find these ratios, we can find the side length ratios and square them because the triangles are similar.</p><p>We already know $DU = \\frac{s}{2}$, so let's try to find it's analogous side for $\\triangle TDV$ and $\\triangle KFU$. These sides are $DV$ and $FU$, respectively. </p><p>First, $\\frac{s}{2} = OD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})$, so $OD = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})$. Then notice that $DV = \\frac{OD}{2}$ because we have to fold $D$ to hit $O$, so the folding crease has to be exactly halfway between $O$ and $D$. Therefore, \\[DV = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{DU}{DV} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})} = 2 \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})\\]</p><p>Now the ratio between the area of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their analogous side lengths. Thus\\[\\frac{[ODU]}{[TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{10 \\cdot [ODU]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\]\\[\\implies \\frac{[ABCDE]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\]\\[\\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})} \\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})\\]</p><p>Now let's move on and calculate the ratio of the other side length. Calculating $FU$ is slightly tricker. First, we find $TD$: $TD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ}) = DV = \\frac{s}{4} sec^54^{\\circ}) \\implies TD = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})$. Now since $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles, $TD = DK$ and $UK = DK-DU = TD-DU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})-\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (sec^2(54^{\\circ})-2) = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1)$.</p><p>Now $FU = UK \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ}) \\implies FU \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1) \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ})$. Now note that $tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x) = 1$ because opposite over adjacent cancel each other out in a right triangle. Thus, $FU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))$</p><p>Now, \\[\\frac{DU}{FU} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))} = \\frac{2}{tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ})}\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies \\frac{[DU]}{[FU]} = \\frac{4}{(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2} \\implies 10 \\cdot [FU] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>Now we go back to our first equation and plug in our values:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = 1+\\sqrt{5}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})+\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\]</p><p>\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (4-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2)\\]</p><p>Note $(tan(x)-tan(90-x))^2 = tan^2(x)-2 \\cdot tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x)+tan^2(90-x) = tan^2(x)-2+tan^2(90-x)$.</p><p>Also note that $tan^2(x)+1 = sec^2(x)$.Thus \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2+(-1)+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) \\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\].</p><p>Now all that remains is to find $tan^2(36^{\\circ})$. We can use the tan addition formula to find the general form of $tan(5x)$ or remember question 25 from this year's AMC 12A. We have that \\[tan(5x) = \\frac{5tan(x)-10tan^3(x)+tan^5(x)}{1-10tan^2(x)+5tan^4(x)}\\]. </p><p>Plug in $x=36$. Then we have \\[tan(180^{\\circ}) = \\frac{5tan(36^{\\circ})-10tan^3(36^{\\circ})+tan^5(36^{\\circ})}{1-10tan^2(36^{\\circ})+5tan^4(36^{\\circ})}\\]Now let $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$. We have the equation \\[\\frac{5y-10y^3+y^5}{1-10y^2+5y^4} = 0 \\implies 5y-10y^3+y^5 = 0\\]\\[\\implies 5-10y^2+y^4 = 0 \\implies 5-10z+z^2 = 0\\]Where we let $z = y^2$. Using the quadratic formula, we have \\[z = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\\]Now since $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$, $z = tan^2(36^{\\circ})$, which is what we were looking for. Notice that $tan(0^{\\circ}) = 0$ and $tan(45^{\\circ}) = 1$, so $tan(36^{\\circ})$ is between $0$ and $1$, and so is it's square. Thus $z = 5 - 2\\sqrt{5}$, not the other root.</p><p>Finally:</p><p>\\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+5-2\\sqrt{5})\\]\\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (6-2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}-4}{4} = \\sqrt{5}-1\\]</p><p>Therefore, \\[[FGHIJ] = \\sqrt{5}-1 = \\boxed{B}\\]</p><p><br/>~KingRavi</p>",
