If there are $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list, we will have $a, b, c, 8, 8, 9, f, g, h, i, j$. In this case, since $8$ is the unique mode, the rest of the integers have to be distinct. So we minimize $a,b,c,f,g,h,i$ in order to maximize $j$. If we let the list be $1,2,3,8,8,9,10,11,12,13,j$, then $j = 11 \\times 10 - (1+2+3+8+8+9+10+11+12+13) = 33$. </p><p>Next, consider the case where there are $3$ occurrences of $8$ in the list.

        "<p>Since the $x^4-51x^2$ part of $x^4-51x^2+50$ has to be less than $-50$ (because we want $x^4-51x^2+50$ to be negative), we have the inequality $x^4-51x^2<-50 \\rightarrow x^2(x^2-51) <-50$. $x^2$ has to be positive, so $(x^2-51)$ is negative. Then we have $x^2<51$. We know that if we find a positive number that works, it's parallel negative will work. Therefore, we just have to find how many positive numbers work, then multiply that by $2$. If we try $1$, we get $1^4-51(1)^4+50 = -50+50 = 0$, and $0$ therefore doesn't work. Test two on your own, and then proceed. Since two works, all numbers above $2$ that satisfy $x^2<51$ work, that is the set {${2,3,4,5,6,7}$}. That equates to $6$ numbers.

        "<p>Let $x^{2}=u$. Then the expression becomes $u^{2}-51u+50$ which can be factored as $\\left(u-1\\right)\\left(u-50\\right)$.

Remember, since $u=x^{2}$ where $x$ is an integer, this means that $u$ is a perfect square between $1$ and $50$. There are $6$ values of $u$ that satisfy this constraint, namely $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$. Solving each of these values for $x$ yields $12$ values (as $x$ can be negative or positive) $\\Longrightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf {(C) } 12}$.~JH. L</p>"

      "question": "<p>The numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ are to be arranged in a circle. An arrangement is $\\textit{bad}$ if it is not true that for every $n$ from $1$ to $15$ one can find a subset of the numbers that appear consecutively on the circle that sum to $n$. Arrangements that differ only by a rotation or a reflection are considered the same. How many different bad arrangements are there?</p>",
      "solutions": [
        "<p>We see that there are $5!$ total ways to arrange the numbers. However, we can always rotate these numbers so that, for example, the number $1$ is always at the top of the circle. Thus, there are only $4!$ ways under rotation. Every case has exactly $1$ reflection, so that gives us only $4!/2$, or $12$ cases, which is not difficult to list out. We systematically list out all $12$ cases. </p><p>Now, we must examine if they satisfy the conditions. We can see that by choosing one number at a time, we can always obtain subsets with sums $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$. By choosing the full circle, we can obtain $15$. By choosing everything except for $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$, we can obtain subsets with sums of $10, 11, 12, 13,$ and $14$. </p><p>This means that we now only need to check for $6, 7, 8,$ and $9$. However, once we have found a set summing to $6$, we can choose all remaining numbers and obtain a set summing to $15-6=9$, and similarly for $7$ and $8$. Thus, we only need to check each case for whether or not we can obtain $6$ or $7$. </p><p>We can make $6$ by having $4, 2$, or $3, 2, 1$, or $5, 1$. We can start with the group of three. To separate $3, 2, 1$ from each other, they must be grouped two together and one separate, like this.</p><p>[asy] draw(circle((0, 0), 5)); pair O, A, B, C, D, E; O=origin; A=(0, 5); B=rotate(72)*A; C=rotate(144)*A; D=rotate(216)*A; E=rotate(288)*A; label(\"$x$\", A, N); label(\"$y$\", C, SW); label(\"$z$\", D, SE); [/asy]</p><p>Now, we note that $x$ is next to both blank spots, so we can't have a number from one of the pairs. So since we can't have $1$, because it is part of the $5, 1$ pair, and we can't have $2$ there, because it's part of the $4, 2$ pair, we must have $3$ inserted into the $x$ spot. We can insert $1$ and $2$ in $y$ and $z$ interchangeably, since reflections are considered the same.</p><p>[asy] draw(circle((0, 0), 5)); pair O, A, B, C, D, E; O=origin; A=(0, 5); B=rotate(72)*A; C=rotate(144)*A; D=rotate(216)*A; E=rotate(288)*A; label(\"$3$\", A, N); label(\"$2$\", C, SW); label(\"$1$\", D, SE); [/asy]</p><p>We have $4$ and $5$ left to insert. We can't place the $4$ next to the $2$ or the $5$ next to the $1$, so we must place $4$ next to the $1$ and $5$ next to the $2$.</p><p>[asy] draw(circle((0, 0), 5)); pair O, A, B, C, D, E; O=origin; A=(0, 5); B=rotate(72)*A; C=rotate(144)*A; D=rotate(216)*A; E=rotate(288)*A; label(\"$3$\", A, N); label(\"$5$\", B, NW); label(\"$2$\", C, SW); label(\"$1$\", D, SE); label(\"$4$\", E, NE); [/asy]</p><p>This is the only solution to make $6$ \"bad.\"</p><p>Next we move on to $7$, which can be made by $3, 4$, or $5, 2$, or $4, 2, 1$. We do this the same way as before. We start with the three group. Since we can't have $4$ or $2$ in the top slot, we must have one there, and $4$ and $2$ are next to each other on the bottom. When we have $3$ and $5$ left to insert, we place them such that we don't have the two pairs adjacent.</p><p>[asy] draw(circle((0, 0), 5)); pair O, A, B, C, D, E; O=origin; A=(0, 5); B=rotate(72)*A; C=rotate(144)*A; D=rotate(216)*A; E=rotate(288)*A; label(\"$1$\", A, N); label(\"$3$\", B, NW); label(\"$2$\", C, SW); label(\"$4$\", D, SE); label(\"$5$\", E, NE); [/asy]</p><p>This is the only solution to make $7$ \"bad.\"</p><p>We've covered all needed cases, and the two examples we found are distinct, therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf {(B) }2}$.</p>",
        "<p>Note that any ordering satisfies the following numbers:</p><p>$1$ through $5:$ choose the number</p><p>$10$ through $14:$ choose all numbers excluding a specific one (such as $1, 2, 3, 4$ in some order for $10$)</p><p>$15:$ choose all the numbers.</p><p>Now, the pairs $7, 8$ and $6, 9$ are the same cases, since if a sequence satisfies a number, we can choose all the remaining numbers to make the other number. ($1, 2, 3$ for $6$, then $4, 5$ for $9$.)</p><p>Thus, we have two cases, whether a sequence doesn't make $6$ or whether a sequence doesn't make $7.$</p><p>$6$ can be made by $(1,2,3), (1, 5), (2, 4).$ We can put $1, 2, 3$ around the circle. $4$ and $5$ now need to go in $2$ of the $3$ spots in between $1, 2, 3.$ Also keeping in mind the other two ways to make $6,$ $4$ has to go in the spot opposite of $2$ and $5$ has to go in the spot opposite of $1.$ Thus the only ordering that works is $1, 4, 3, 5, 2$ (ignore rotations and reflections).</p><p>Similarly, for the case with $7,$ the only ordering that works is $1, 5, 4, 2, 3$ with gives the answer of $\\mathbf{(B) }2.$</p>",
        "<p>Note that $\\{1,2,3,4,5,10,11,12,13,14,15\\}$ will always be there. Thus, we need to prevent either the $(6,9)$ or the $(7,8)$ pair. We consider the neighbors of 5. </p><p>Case 1: No 7s. Then we have $1-5-4$, and the neighbor of 4 cannot be 3 so the full config must be $3-1-5-4-2$. </p><p>Case 2: No 6s. Then we have $2-5-3$, and the neighbor of 2 cannot be 4, so the full config must be $1-2-5-3-4$. </p><p>Both of these are bad, and they're the only bads, so the answer is $\\textbf{(B)} \\text{ }2$.</p>",
        "<p>Like all previous solutions, we only need to find an arrangement where a sum of $6$ or $7$ isn't achievable. Reflections and rotations are considered the same, so there are actually only $\\frac{5!}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 12$ distinct arrangements. We can simply draw all $12$ arrangements and cross out the ones that aren't bad, leaving us with $\\boxed{2}$ bad arrangements.</p>"
