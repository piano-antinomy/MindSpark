Lets take the first case in which both numbers are positive: The region which has these desired values is the square [$(10,10) ,(0,0) ,(10,0) ,(0,10)$]. Similarly if both numbers are negative we get the square [$(-20,-20), (0,0), (-20,0) ,(0,-20)$] Then we find the area of the possible region $30\\cdot 30 = 900$ and then find the areas of our positive regions $10\\cdot 10=100$ and $20\\cdot 20 = 400$.

Assume the octagon has side length $1$. The triangles are right isosceles triangles with the hypotenuse 1, so their side length is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and the area of one triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$. The area of all 4 triangles is then just $1$. The rectangles share one side with the octagon, and another with the triangle. The octagon has side length 1, and the triangle has side length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ as found earlier. So the area of one rectangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The area of all 4 is $4\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=2\\sqrt{2}$. Finally, the area of the square in the middle is $1\\cdot1=1$. The total area is $1+1+2\\sqrt{2}=2+2\\sqrt{2}$. We want the area of the square over the area of the octagon, which is $\\frac{1}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}$. Rationalize by multiplying both numerator and denominator by $2-2\\sqrt{2}$: $\\frac{1}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\frac{2-2\\sqrt{2}}{2-2\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{2-2\\sqrt{2}}{\\left(2+2\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(2-2\\sqrt{2}\\right)}$. By the difference of squares, the denominator reduces to $-4$ and the fraction is $\\frac{2-2\\sqrt{2}}{-4}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}}$.</p><p>~Explanation by JH.

        "<p>The largest difference, $9,$ must be between $w$ and $z.$</p><p>The smallest difference, $1,$ must be directly between two integers. This also means the differences directly between the other two should add up to $8.$ The only remaining differences that would make this possible are $3$ and $5.$ However, those two differences can't be right next to each other because they would make a difference of $8,$ which isn't given as a possibility in the problem. This means $1$ must be the difference between $y$ and $x.$ We can express the possible configurations as the lines.</p><p><br/></p><p>If we look at the first number line, you can express $x$ as $w-5,$ $y$ as $w-6,$ and $z$ as $w-9.$ Since the sum of all these integers equal $44$,\\begin{align*} w+w-5+w-6+w-9&=44\\\\ 4w&=64\\\\ w&=16 \\end{align*}You can do something similar to this with the second number line to find the other possible value of $w.$\\begin{align*} w+w-3+w-4+w-9&=44\\\\ 4w&=60\\\\ w&=15 \\end{align*}The sum of the possible values of $w$ is $16+15 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$</p>",
        "<p>First, like Solution 1, we know that $w-z=9 \\ \\text{(1)}$, because no two numbers could have a larger difference. Next, we find the sum of all the differences; since $w$ is in the positive part of a difference 3 times, and has no differences where it contributes as the negative part, the sum of the differences includes $3w$. Continuing in this way, we find that \\[3w+x-y-3z=28 \\ \\text{(2)}\\]. Now, we can subtract $3w-3z=27$ from (2) to get $x-y=1 \\ \\text{(3)}$. Also, adding (2) with $w+x+y+z=44$ gives $4w+2x-2z=72$, or $2w+x-z=36$. Subtracting (1) from this gives $w+x=27$. Since we know $w-z$ and $x-y$, we find that \\[(w-z)+(x-y)=(w-y)+(x-z)=9+1=10\\]. This means that $w-y$ and $x-z$ must be 4 and 6, in some order. If $w-y=6$, then subtracting this from (3) gives $(w-y)-(x-y)=6-1=5$, so $w-x=5$. This means that $(w-x)+(w+x)=2w=27+5=32$, so $w=16$. Similarly, $w$ can also equal $15$.</p><p>Now if you are in a rush, you most likely would have answered $16+15=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$. But we do have to check if these work. In fact, they do, giving solutions $(w,x,y,z)=(16, 11, 10, 7)$ and $(w,x,y,z)=(15, 12, 11, 6)$.</p>",
        "<p>Let $w - x = a$, $w - y = b$, $w - z = c$. As above, we know that $c = 9$. Thus, $a < b < c$. So, we have $w + x + y + z = w + (w - a) + (w - b) + (w - 9) = 4w - a - b - 9 = 44$. This means $a + b + 9$ is a multiple of $4$. Testing values of $a$ and $b$, we find $(a, b, c) = (1, 6, 9), (3, 4, 9),$ and $(5, 6, 9)$ all satisfy this relation. The corresponding $(w, x, y, z)$ sets are $(15, 14, 9, 6), (15, 12, 11, 6),$ and $(16, 11, 10, 7)$. The first set does not satisfy the given conditions, but the other two do. Thus, $w = 15$ and $w = 16$ are both possible solutions so the answer is $16+15=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$.</p>",
        "<p>From the problem, we know that $w+x+y+z=44$. Since it is said that the pairwise positive differences between numbers are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and we can figure that the pairwise positive differences are $(w-x)$, $(w-y)$, $(w-z)$, $(x-y)$, $(x-z)$, $(y-z)$, the sum of $(w-x), (w-y), (w-z), (x-y), (x-z), (y-z)$ is equal to the sum of 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, so $(w-x)+(w-y)+(w-z)+(x-y)+(x-z)+(y-z)=28$. Simplifying, we get $3w-3z+x-y=28$. Adding $w+x+y+z=44$ and $(w-x)+(w-y)+(w-z)+(x-y)+(x-z)+(y-z)=28$, we get $4w+2x-2z=72$, and simplifying we get $2w+x-z=36$. Since $x-z$ is one of our positive differences, we can start guessing values for $w$, and if the equation simplifies to one of our numerical positive differences, that value of $w$ should work. We can start at $w=18$ and keep going down, because our sum has to be positive. For $w=18$, $x-z=0$, which is not one of our sums. For $w=17$, $x-z=2$,which is not one of our sums. For $w=16$, $x-z=4$, which is one of our sums, so 16 works. For $w=15$, $x-z=6$, which is one of our sums, so 15 works. For $w=14$, $x-z=8$, which is not one of our sums. If we keep going, $x-z$ will soon exceed 10 and exceed all our sums, so any value below $w=14$ will not work. Therefore, our only solutions for $w$ are 15 and 16, which means our sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$. You can check that 15 and 16 work by forming a string of 4 numbers as shown above.</p>",
        "<p>Because we know that $w>x>y>z$ and that the positive differences are $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9$, we can immediately come to the conclusion that $w-z= 9$ (because w is the largest integer and z is the smallest integer, so their difference must be the greatest). With this we have $3$ equations, we have that $x+y+z+w=44$ (from the problem), $w-z=9$ and because we can add up all the possible possible differences (as shown in the previous solutions), we get that $3w+x-y-3z=28$. With these equations, we eventually manipulate these equations by doing the first equation minus 3 times the second to get $x-y=1$. We can also add the first and third equation and subtract the second equation to get $w+x=27$ thus we know that $w-x$ can be $3, 4, 5,$ and $6$ (note: 1 and 9 are not possible because we know that $x-y=1$ and $w-z=9$ and the remaining differences can only be taken by 1 pair, so $w-x$ cannot be equal to 1 or 9). However, in order to get an integer value for x and z, we find that $w-z$ can only be equal to 3 and 5. Thus, by solving these, we see that $w= 15$ and $w=16$. $15+16=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }31}$.</p>"

        "<p>Notice that the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ won't be affected by $2000$. Essentially we could solve the problem by finding the hundreds digit of $11^{2011}$. Powers of $11$ are special because they can be represented by the Pascal's Triangle. Drawing the triangle, there is a theorem that states the powers of $11$ can be found by reading rows of the triangle and adding extra numbers up. [add source] For example, the sixth row of the triangle is $1, 5, 10, 10, 5,$ and $1$. Adding all numbers from right to left, we get $161051$, which is also $11^5$. In other words, each number is $10^n$ steps from the right side of the row. The hundreds digit is $0$. We can do the same for $11^{2011}$, but we only need to find the $3$ digits from the right. Observing, every $3$ number from the right is $1 + 2 + 3... + n$. So to find the third number from the right on the row of $11^{2011}$, \\[f(11^n) = 1 + 2 + 3... + (n-1),\\] or $\\frac{(2010 \\cdot 2011)}{2}$, or $2021055$.

      "solutions": [
        "<p>For $y=mx+2$ to not pass through any lattice points with $0<x\\leq 100$ is the same as saying that $mx\\notin\\mathbb Z$ for $x\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$, or in other words, $m$ is not expressible as a ratio of positive integers $s/t$ with $t\\leq 100$. Hence the maximum possible value of $a$ is the first real number after $1/2$ that is so expressible.</p><p>For each $d=2,\\dots,100$, the smallest multiple of $1/d$ which exceeds $1/2$ is $1,\\frac23,\\frac34,\\frac35,\\dots,\\frac{50}{98},\\frac{50}{99},\\frac{51}{100}$ respectively, and the smallest of these is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{50}{99}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We see that for the graph of $y=mx+2$ to not pass through any lattice points, the denominator of $m$ must be greater than $100$, or else it would be canceled by some $0<x\\le100$ which would make $y$ an integer. By using common denominators, we find that the order of the fractions from smallest to largest is $\\text{(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)}$. We can see that when $m=\\frac{50}{99}$, $y$ could be an integer, so therefore any fraction greater than $\\frac{50}{99}$ would not work, as substituting our fraction $\\frac{50}{99}$ for $m$ would produce an integer for $y$. So now we are left with only $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$. But since $\\frac{51}{101}=\\frac{5049}{9999}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}=\\frac{5050}{9999}$, we can be absolutely certain that there isn't a number between $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$ that can reduce to a fraction whose denominator is less than or equal to $100$. Since we are looking for the maximum value of $a$, we take the larger of $\\frac{51}{101}$ and $\\frac{50}{99}$, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{50}{99}}$.</p>",
        "<p>We want to find the smallest $m$ such that there will be an integral solution to $y=mx+2$ with $0<x\\le100$. We first test A, but since the denominator has a $101$, $x$ must be a nonzero multiple of $101$, but it then will be greater than $100$.

        "<p>Proceeding similarly to the first solution, we have that sides of each triangle are of the form $a, a+1, a+2$ for some number $a$. Also, note that the perimeter of each triangle is half of the previous one. In order for the triangle to not exist, it must not satisfy the triangle inequality, meaning that $a + a + 1 < a+2 \\Rightarrow a<1$. Then, the perimeter would be $a + a + 1 + a + 2 = 3a + 3 < 6$. So, to have a proper triangle, we have $\\frac{3018}{2^{k}} > 6 \\Rightarrow 2^k < 503 \\Rightarrow 2^{k} < 512$. The first triangle to not work would have perimeter $\\frac{3018}{256} = \\frac{1509}{128}$, thus the answer is  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\frac{1509}{128}}$.</p>",
        "<p>This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$. Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$. Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$, and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$. If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$. Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$, we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$, is indeed equal to $\\frac{P_1}{2}$. Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \\frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$, $P_n = \\frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$. Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$, we get that $P_n = \\frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$. If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us:First Sequence:$x_1 < 2012$</p><p>$x_2 < 2013$</p><p>$x_3 < 2011$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is:$x_1 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$</p><p>$x_2 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$</p><p>$x_3 < \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$.The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \\frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$. Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when:$2^{n-2} < 503$(You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$. If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$, we see that $P_n = \\frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$. Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$(and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\\boxed{D}$.</p><p>~ilikemath247365</p>"
