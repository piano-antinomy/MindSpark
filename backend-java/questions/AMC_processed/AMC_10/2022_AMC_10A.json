        "<p>To start, we can apply a couple formulas to find the circumradius and the area of the cyclic quadrilateral, and then just subtract the area of the quadrilateral from the area of the circle, and that is our final answer. This formula is really tedious with many calculations so don't do this in a contest. To find the circumradius we have: \\[\\text{Circumradius} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}}\\]If we let $a = 7, b = 24, c = 20, \\text{and}, d = 15$, that means that the semi-perimeter is just \\[\\dfrac{7+24+20+15}{2} = 33\\]. Note that $s$ stands for the semi-perimeter. The calculations will take very long so Im just going to skip to the answer of $\\dfrac{25}{2}$ as our circumradius. This means that the area of the circle is $\\dfrac{625}{4}\\pi$. Now applying Brahmagupta's formula to find the area of a cyclic quadrilateral which is just: \\[\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}\\]. Again we will use the same representations as these letters from before, so $a = 7, b = 24, c = 20, \\text{and}, d = 15$. Plugging in the numbers we have that the area is $234$.

Thus, the triangle is a $45-45-90$ isosceles triangle.This conclusion can also be reached by cutting the bottom square across a diagonal and noticing that each resulting triangle is congruent to each triangle wedged between the hexagons by symmetry.

        "<p>Since the $13$ cards are picked up in two passes, the first pass must pick up the first $n$ cards and the second pass must pick up the remaining cards $m$ through $13$. Also note that if $m$, which is the card that is numbered one more than $n$, is placed before $n$, then $m$ will not be picked up on the first pass since cards are picked up in order. Therefore we desire $m$ to be placed before $n$ to create a second pass, and that after the first pass, the numbers $m$ through $13$ are lined up in order from least to greatest.</p><p>To construct this, $n$ cannot go in the $n$th position because all cards $1$ to $n-1$ will have to precede it and there will be no room for $m$.

Then cards $m$ and $m+1$ must go in the remaining two slots, and there is only one way to order them since they must be in increasing order.
