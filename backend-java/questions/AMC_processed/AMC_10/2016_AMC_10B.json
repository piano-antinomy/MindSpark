Note that the center of dilation must have an $x$-coordinate less than $2$; if the $x$-coordinate were otherwise, then the circle under the transformation would not have an increased $x$-coordinate in the coordinate plane. Also, the ratio of dilation must be equal to $\\dfrac{3}{2}$, which is the ratio of the radii of the circles.

We do not have to include absolute value symbols because we know that the center of dilation has a lower $x$-coordinate, and hence a lower $y$-coordinate, from our reasoning above. Solving the two equations, we get $x = -4$ and $y = - 6$. This means that any point $(a,b)$ on the plane will dilate to the point $\\left( \\dfrac{3}{2} (a + 4) - 4, \\dfrac{3}{2} (b + 6) - 6 \\right)$, which means that the point $(0,0)$ dilates to $\\left( 6 - 4, 9 - 6 \\right) = (2,3)$.
