        "<p>In order to solve this problem, we must first visualize what the region looks like. We know that, in a three dimensional space, the region consisting of all points within $3$ units of a point would be a sphere with radius $3$. However, we need to find the region containing all points within $3$ units of a segment. It can be seen that our region is a cylinder with two hemispheres/endcaps on either end. We know the volume of our region, so we set up the following equation (the volume of our cylinder + the volume of our two hemispheres will equal $216 \\pi$):</p><p>$\\frac{4 \\pi }{3} \\cdot 3^3+9 \\pi x=216 \\pi$, where $x$ is equal to the length of our line segment.</p><p>Solving, we find that $x = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 20}$.</p>",
        "<p>Because this is just a cylinder and $2$ hemispheres (\"half spheres\"), and the radius is $3$, the volume of the $2$ hemispheres is $\\frac{4(3^3)\\pi}{3} = 36 \\pi$. Since we also know that the volume of this whole thing is $216 \\pi$, we do $216 \\pi-36 \\pi$ to get $180 \\pi$ as the volume of the cylinder. Thus the height is $180 \\pi$ divided by the area of the base, or $\\frac{180 \\pi}{9\\pi}=20$, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 20}.$</p><p>~Minor edit by virjoy2001 and slamgirls</p>"

The coordinates are $(\\pm 3,\\pm 4), (\\pm 4, \\pm 3), (0,\\pm 5),$ and $(\\pm 5,0).$ We want to maximize $PQ$ and minimize $RS.$ They also have to be non perfect squares, because they are both irrational. The greatest value of $PQ$ happens when $P$ and $Q$ are almost directly across from each other and are in different quadrants. For example, the endpoints of the segment could be $(-4,3)$ and $(3,-4)$ because the two points are almost across from each other. Another possible pair could be $(-4,3)$ and $(5,0)$. To find out which segment is longer, we have to compare the distances from their endpoints to a diameter (which must be the longest possible segment). The closest diameter would be from $(-4,3)$ to $(4,-3)$. The distance between $(3,-4)$ and $(-4,3)$ is greater than the distance between $(5,0)$ and $(4,-3)$. Therefore, the segment from $(3,-4)$ to $(-4,3)$ is the longest attainable (the other possible coordinates for $P$ and $Q$ are $(4,3)$ and $(-3, -4)$, $(3, 4)$ and $(-4, -3)$, $(-3, 4)$ and $(4, -3)$. The least value of $RS$ is when the two endpoints are in the same quadrant and are very close to each other. This can occur when, for example, $R$ is $(3,4)$ and $S$ is $(4,3).$ They are in the same quadrant and no other point on the circle with integer coordinates is closer to the point $(3,4)$ than $(4,3)$ and vice versa.

Thus, the smallest possible value of $RS$ is $\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$. Assuming that $\\frac{PQ}{RS} = 7$, we plug in $RS = \\sqrt{2}$ and solve for $PQ$: $PQ=7\\sqrt{2}$. Remember, we don't know if this is possible yet, we are only trying to figure out if it is. But for what values of $x$ and $y$ does $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=7\\sqrt2$? We see that this can easily be made into a $45-45-90$ triangle. But, instead of substituting $y=x$ into the equation and then using a whole lot of algebra, we can save time and use the little trick, that if in a $45-45-90$ triangle, the two $45$ degree sides have side length $s$, then the hypotenuse is $s\\sqrt2$.

Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. The only answer choice that satisfies $n+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 1239}$.</p>",
        "<p>One divisibility rule that we can use for this problem is that a multiple of $9$ will always have its digits sum to a multiple of $9$. We can find out that the least number of digits the number $n$ has is $142$, with $141$ $9$'s and $1$ $5$, assuming the rule above. No matter what arrangement or different digits we use, the divisibility rule stays the same. To make the problem simpler, we can just use the $141$ $9$'s and $1$ $5$. By randomly mixing the digits up, we are likely to get: $9999$...$9995999$...$9999$. By adding $1$ to this number, we get: $9999$...$9996000$...$0000$.Knowing that $n+1$ is divisible by $9$ when $6$, we can subtract $6$ from every available choice, and see if the number is divisible by $9$ afterwards.After subtracting $6$ from every number, we can conclude that $1233$ (originally $1239$) is the only number divisible by $9$. So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239}$.</p>",

Thus, if $1$ is the correct answer, then the equation $9x=1274$ must have an integer solution (i.e. $1274$ must be divisible by $9$). But since it does not, $1$ is not the correct answer.</p><p>If $B$ is correct, then $n$ must be some number $29999999...9$, because when we add one to $29999999...9$, we get $30000000...00$. Thus, if $3$ is the correct answer, then the equation $2+9x=1274$ must have an integer solution. But since it does not, $3$ is not the correct answer.</p><p>Based on what we have done for evaluating the previous two answer choices, we can create an equation we can use to evaluate the final three possibilities. Notice that if $S(n+1)=N$, then $n$ must be a number whose initial digits sum to $N-1$, and whose other, terminating digits, are all $9$. Thus, we can evaluate the three final possibilities by seeing if the equation $(N-1)+9x=1274$ has an integer solution.</p><p>The equation does not have an integer solution for $N=12$, so $C$ is not correct.

The polynomial is $h(x)=(1-a)x^3 + (b-1)x^2 + 90x + c$, and must be equal to $(1-a)g(x)$. Equating the coefficients, we get $3$ equations. We will tackle the situation one equation at a time, starting the $x$ terms. Looking at the coefficients, we get $\\dfrac{90}{1-a} = 1$. \\[\\therefore 90=1-a.\\] The solution to the previous is obviously $a=-89$. We can now find $b$ and $c$. $\\dfrac{b-1}{1-a} = a$, \\[\\therefore b-1=a(1-a)=-89*90=-8010\\] and $b=-8009$. Finally $\\dfrac{c}{1-a} = 10$, \\[\\therefore c=10(1-a)=10*90=900\\] Solving the original problem, $f(1)=1 + 1 + b + 100 + c = 102+b+c=102+900-8009=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\, -7007}$.</p>",

This motivates us to long divide to obtain the quotient function. After simple long division $q(x) = x + (1 - a)$. In addition, what is left over, namely $r(x)$, has a constant piece of $a + 89$ (you'll see in a few sentences why we only care about particularly the constant piece).</p><p>Now we can write: $f(1) = (a + 12) \\cdot (2 - a)$.</p><p>Now, as we have already established $r(x) = 0$ for ALL $x$ that means $r(0)$ or the constant piece is $0$, so $89 + a = 0$, in which we obtain $a = -89$.

Each of those multiples of $11$ contributes $2 \\cdot 2=4$ valid permutations, but we overcounted by a factor of $2$; every permutation of $209$, for example, is also a permutation of $902$.
