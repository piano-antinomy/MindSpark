There are 8 vertices, but each blue dot is the intersection of 2 lines, corresponding to $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ vertices. So there are $\\frac{20 \\cdot 8}{4} = 40$ blue dots.</p><p>The number of intersection dots are the sum of the number of red and blue dots. Hence, the answer is $40 + 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }49}$.</p><p>~<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Isabelchen\" rel=\"nofollow\">isabelchen</a></p>",
        "<p>Notice that there can be a maximum of 4 lines intersecting at any point inside the octagon. Now, let $P_2$ be the number of points where at least $2$ lines intersect, and define $P_3$ and $P_4$ similarly. By PIE, we have that the desired number of points is\\[P_2 - 2P_3 + 3P_4\\]We now separately count the $P_i's$. </p><p><br/>Case 1 (P_2):Notice that if we pick any $4$ points, there is exactly $1$ way $2$ lines can be drawn such that they intersect inside the convex hull of the $4$ points. Thus, $P_2 = {8 \\choose 4} = 70$.</p><p><br/>Case 2 (P_3):The only ways that $3$ diagonals concur is if they are all the longest (main) diagonals in the octagon, or one of them is a main diagonal and the other $2$ intersect on said diagonal. If they are all the main diagonals, there are $4$ ways. If only one of them is a main diagonal, then there are $4(2) = 8$ ways. In total, there are $8 + 4 = 12$ such points.</p><p><br/>Case 3 (P_4): The only way this can happen is if all $4$ diagonals intersect in the center (they are all main diagonals), giving $1$ way.</p><p><br/>Thus, in total we have\\[70 - 2(12) + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 49}\\]such points.</p><p>~mathwiz_1207</p>"
