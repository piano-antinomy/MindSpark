To find this, we can find the coordinates of $F$ and the point where the altitude from $F$ touches $EB$, which we will call point $X$. Immediately, we know that the coordinates of $F$ are $(3,2)$, given the values on the rectangle, and we can find the coordinates of point $X$ by first noticing that the equation of $EB$ is $y = \\dfrac{-2x}{3}+2$. Because of perpendicular slopes being the inverse reciprocal of the original slope, the equation for FX is $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}-\\dfrac{5}{2}$. From this, $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}+b$, and $2=\\dfrac{3(3)}{2}+b$, so $b = \\dfrac{-5}{2}$. Now the intersection of these two equations can be found to be $(\\dfrac{27}{13},\\dfrac{8}{13})$.

Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$, so $c=37$. Therefore, $j=38$. Now, since $j-1=37$, by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$, so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$.</p>",

Therefore, the difference between Chloe and Zoe's age is $36$, so Chloe is $37$, and Joey is $38$. The common factor that will divide both of their ages is $37$, so Joey will be $74$.

We are told that $C+n$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ exactly nine times. Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$, it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$, including every factor of $C-Z$. For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$, the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$, which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$. Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.) We also know $Z=1$ and $J=C+1$. Thus,\\begin{align*} C-Z&=36, \\\\ J-Z&=37. \\end{align*}By our above logic, the next time $J-Z$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ will occur when $Z+n$ is a factor of $J-Z$.

        "<p>Preamble: In this solution, we define the sequence $A$ to satisfy $a_n = f(n),$ where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term of the sequence $A.$ This solution will show a few different perspectives. Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated. </p><p>To begin, we consider the sequence $B$ formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between $A.$ Define $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.$ Notice that for $n \\ge 4,$ we have </p><p> Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that $b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.$</p><p>If you didn\u2019t notice that $B$ repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence $b_n$ so that you could define $c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.$ Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that $c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.$ The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is $0,$ in which you have that $b_{n} = b_{n+6}.$ In the case in which finite differences didn\u2019t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of $C$ to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence. Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \\ldots\\] in which the same result follows. </p><p>Using the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully. Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \\ldots\\] (If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.)</p><p>Now, there are two ways to finish. </p><p>Finish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \\cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$</p><p>Finish Method #2: Notice that $a_{2018} = a_{2017} - a_{2016} + 2018 = B_{2016} + 2018 = -1 + 2018 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$</p><p>~Professor-Mom</p>",
