Letting the larger angle in each trapezoid be $x$, the two angles formed by the line each measures $(180-x)^\\circ$. There are $8$ congruent angles left. Each of those angles measures $(360-2x)^\\circ$. Putting it all together: $8(360-2x)+2(180-x)=1440\\implies x=\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A)\\ }100^\\circ}$.</p>",
        "<p>If we reflect the arch across the line, we form an 18-gon. $\\frac{180*(18-2)}{18} = 160^\\circ$ so each interior angle of the 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. Let $x$ be the degree measure of the larger interior angle of a trapezoid. From the diagram, we see that $2x + 160 = 360$, so $2x = 200$ and $x = 100$, or $\\boxed{A}$.</p>"

      "question": "<p>Each face of a cube is given a single narrow stripe painted from the center of one edge to the center of the opposite edge. The choice of the edge pairing is made at random and independently for each face. What is the probability that there is a continuous stripe encircling the cube?</p>",

        "<p>There are two possible stripe orientations for each of the six faces of the cube, so there are $2^6 = 64$ possible stripe combinations. There are three pairs of parallel faces so, if there is an encircling stripe, then the pair of faces that does not contribute uniquely determines the stripe orientation for the remaining faces. In addition, the stripe on each face that does not contribute may be oriented in either of two different ways. So a total of $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$ stripe combinations on the cube result in a continuous stripe around the cube. The required probability is $\\frac {12}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac {3}{16}}$.</p><p>Without loss of generality, orient the cube so that the stripe on the top face goes from front to back. There are two mutually exclusive ways for there to be an encircling stripe: either the front, bottom and back faces are painted to complete an encircling stripe with the top face's stripe or the front, right, back and left faces are painted to form an encircling stripe. The probability of the first case is $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^3 = \\frac 18$, and the probability of the second case is $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^4 = \\frac {1}{16}$. The cases are disjoint, so the probabilities sum to $\\frac 18 + \\frac {1}{16} = \\boxed {\\frac {3}{16}}$.</p><p>There are three possible orientations of an encircling stripe. For any one of these to appear, the stripes on the four faces through which the continuous stripe is to pass must be properly aligned. The probability of each such stripe alignment is $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^4 = \\frac {1}{16}$.
