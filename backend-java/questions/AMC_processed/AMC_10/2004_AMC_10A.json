        "<p>WLOG, let the side length of $ABCD$ be 1. Let $DE = x$. It suffices that $AE = 1 - x$. Then triangles $ABE$ and $CBF$ are congruent by HL, so $CF = AE$ and $DE = DF$. We find that $BE = EF = x \\sqrt{2}$, and so, by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have$(1 - x)^2 + 1 = 2x^2.$ This yields $x^2 + 2x = 2$, so $x^2 = 2 - 2x$. Thus, the desired ratio of areas is\\[\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x^2}{2}}{\\dfrac{1-x}{2}} = \\dfrac{x^2}{1 - x} = \\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}.\\]</p>",
        "<p>Assume $AB=1$. Then, $FC$ is $x$ and $ED$ is $1-x$. We see that using $HL$, $FCB$ is congruent to EAB. Using Pythagoras of triangles $FCB$ and $FDE$ we get $2{(1-x)}^2=x^2+1$. Expanding, we get $2x^2-4x+2=x^2+1$. Simplifying gives $x^2-4x+1=0$ solving using completing the square (or other methods) gives 2 answers: $2-\\sqrt{3}$ and $2+\\sqrt{3}$. Because $x < 1$, $x=2-\\sqrt{3}$. Using the areas, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}$</p>",
        "<p>First, since $\\bigtriangleup BEF$ is equilateral and $ABCD$ is a square, by the Hypothenuse Leg Theorem, $\\bigtriangleup ABE$ is congruent to $\\bigtriangleup CBF$. Then, assume length $AB = BC = x$ and length $DE = DF = y$, then $AE = FC = x - y$. $\\bigtriangleup BEF$ is equilateral, so $EF = EB$ and $EB^2 = EF^2$, it is given that $ABCD$ is a square and $\\bigtriangleup DEF$ and $\\bigtriangleup ABE$ are right triangles. Then we use the Pythagorean theorem to prove that $AB^2 + AE^2 = EB^2$ and since we know that $EB^2 = EF^2$ and $EF^2 = DE^2 + DF^2$, which means $AB^2 + AE^2 = DE^2 + DF^2$. Now we plug in the variables and the equation becomes $x^2 + (x-y)^2 = 2y^2$, expand and simplify and you get $2x^2 - 2xy = y^2$. We want the ratio of area of $\\bigtriangleup DEF$ to $\\bigtriangleup ABE$. Expressed in our variables, the ratio of the area is $\\frac{y^2}{x^2 - xy}$ and we know $2x^2 - 2xy = y^2$, so the ratio must be $2$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }2}$</p>"

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, it is easy to see that the circumradius of the base is $\\dfrac { 2 \\sqrt {3 } } {3}$. We can use PT again to find the height of the tetrahedron given its base's circumradius and it's leg lengths.
