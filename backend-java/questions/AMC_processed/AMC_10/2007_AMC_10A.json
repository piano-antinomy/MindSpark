Easy to directly disprove.</p><p>Case 2: $197u$. $S(n) = 1 + 9 + 7 + u = 17 + u$, and $S(S(n)) = 8+u$ if $u \\le 2$ and $S(S(n)) = 2 + (u-3) = u-1$ otherwise. </p><p>Case 3: $198u$. $S(n) = 18 + u$, and $S(S(n)) = 9 + u$ if $u \\le 1$ and $2 + (u-2) = u$ otherwise.</p><p>Case 4: $199u$. But $S(n) > 19$, and $n + S(n)$ clearly sum to $> 2007$.</p><p>Case 5: $200u$. So $S(n) = 2 + u$ and $S(S(n)) = 2 + u$ (recall that $n < 2007$), and $2000 + u + 2 + u + 2 + u = 2004 + 3u = 2007 \\Longrightarrow u = 1$. Fourth solution.</p><p>In total we have $4 \\mathrm{(D)}$ solutions, which are $1977, 1980, 1983,$ and $2001$.</p>",
        "<p>Clearly, $n > 1950$.

        "<p>It is well-known that $n \\equiv S(n)\\equiv S(S(n)) \\pmod{9}.$ Substituting, we have that \\[n+n+n \\equiv 2007 \\pmod{9} \\implies n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\\] Since $n \\leq 2007,$ we must have that $\\max S(n)=1+9+9+9=28.$ Now, we list out the possible values for $S(n)$ in a table, noting that it is a multiple of $3$ because $n$ is a multiple of $3.$</p><p>Then, we compute the corresponding values of $S(S(n)).$</p><p>Finally, we may compute the corresponding values of $n$ using the fact that $n=2007-S(n)-S(S(n)).$</p><p>Notice how all conditions are designed to be satisfied except whether $S(n)$ is accurate with respect to $n.$ So, the only thing that remains is to check this.

        "<p>As in Solution 1, we note that $S(n)\\leq 28$ and $S(S(n))\\leq 10$. <br/>Obviously, $n\\equiv S(n)\\equiv S(S(n)) \\pmod 9$. <br/>As $2007\\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$, this means that $n\\bmod 9 \\in\\{0,3,6\\}$, or equivalently that $n\\equiv S(n)\\equiv S(S(n))\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.</p><p>Thus $S(S(n))\\in\\{3,6,9\\}$.

        "<p>Claim. The only positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are perfect multiples of $3$.</p><p>Proof of claim:We examine the positive integers mod $9$. Here are the cases.</p><p>Case 1. $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. Now, we examine $S(n)$ modulo $9$.Case 1.1. The tens digit of $n$ is different from the tens digit of the largest multiple of $9$ under $n$. (In other words, this means we will carry when adding from the perfect multiple of $9$ under $n$.)Observe that when we carry, i.e. Add $1$ onto $1989$ to obtain $1990$, the units digit decreases by $9$ while the tens digit increases by $1$. This means that the sum of the digits decreases by $8$ in total, and we have $-8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$, so the \"mod 9\" of the sum increases by $1$. This means that, regardless of whether the sum carries or not, the modulo 9 of the sum of the digits always increases by $1$.</p><p>Case 1.2. The tens digits are the same, which is trivial since the units digit just increases by $1$ which means that the sum is also equivalent to $1 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>This means that $S(n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$ and similarly letting the next $n=S(n)$, $S(S(n)) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$. Summing these, we have $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$. Clearly, no integers of this form will satisfy the condition because $2007$ is a perfect multiple of $9$.</p><p>Case 2. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>In this case, we apply exactly the same argument. There is at most one carry, which means that the sum of the digits will always be congruent to $2$ mod $9$. Then we can apply similar arguments to get $S(n) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$ and $S(S(n)) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9$, so adding gives $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.</p><p>It is trivial to see that for $n \\equiv k \\pmod 9$, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 8$, we must have $n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3k \\pmod 9$. Only when $k=0, 3, 6$ is $3k$ a multiple of $9$, which means that $n$ must be a multiple of $3$.</p><p>Now, we find the integers. Again, consider two cases: Integers that are direct multiples of $9$ and integers that are multiples of $3$ but not $9$.</p><p>Case 1. $n$ is a multiple of $9$. An integer of the form $\\overline{20ab}$ will not work since the least such integer is $2007$ which already exceeds our bounds. Thus, we need only consider the integers of the form $\\overline{19ab}$. The valid sums of the digits of $n$ are $18$ and $27$ in this case.</p><p>Case 1.1. The sum of the digits is $18$. This means that $S(n)=18, S(S(n))=9$, so $n=2007-18-9=1980$. Clearly this number satisfies our constraints.</p><p>Case 1.2. The sum of the digits is $27$. This means that $S(n)=27, S(S(n))=9$, ,so $n=2007-27-9=1971$. Since the sum of the digits of $1971$ is not $27$, this does not work.</p><p>This means that there is $1$ integer in this case.</p><p>Case 2. $n$ is a multiple of $3$, not $9$..Case 2.1. Integers of the form $\\overline{20ab}$. Then $S(n)=3$ or $S(n)=6$; it is trivial to see that $S(n)=6$ exceeds our bounds, so $S(n)=3$ and $n=2007-6=2001$.</p><p>Case 2.2. Integers of the form $\\overline{19ab}$. Then $S(n)=12, 15, 21, 24$ and we consider each case separately.</p><p>Case 2.2.1. Integers with $S(n)=12$. That means $n=2007-12-3=1992$ which clearly does not work.</p><p>Case 2.2.2. Integers with $S(n)=15$. That means $n=2007-15-6=1986$ which also does not work</p><p>Case 2.2.3. Integers with $S(n)=21$. That means $n=2007-21-3=1983$ which is valid.</p><p>Case 2.2.4. Integers with $S(n)=24$. That means $n=2007-24-6=1977$ which is also valid.</p><p>We have considered every case, so there are $\\boxed{4}$ integers that satisfy the given condition.</p><p>~Refined by HamstPan38825</p>",
        "<p>Let the number of digits of $n$ be $m$. If $m = 5$, $n$ will already be greater than $2007$. Notice that $S(n)$ is always at most $9m$. Then if $m = 3$, $n$ will be at most $999$, $S(n)$ will be at most $27$, and $S(S(n))$ will be even smaller than $27$. Clearly we cannot reach a sum of $2007$, unless $m = 4$ (i.e. $n$ has $4$ digits).</p><p>Then, let $n$ be a four digit number in the form $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$. Then $S(n) = a + b + c + d$.</p><p>$S(S(n))$ is the sum of the digits of $a + b + c + d$. We can represent $S(S(n))$ as the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of $S(n)$. The tens digit in the form of a decimal is</p><p><br/>$\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}$.</p><p><br/>To remove the decimal portion, we can simply take the floor of the expression,</p><p><br/>$\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Now that we have expressed the tens digit, we can express the ones digit as $S(n) -10$ times the above expression, or</p><p><br/>$a + b + c + d - 10\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Adding the two expressions yields the value of $S(S(n))$</p><p><br/>$= a + b + c + d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Combining this expression to the ones for $n$ and $S(n)$ yields</p><p><br/>$1002a + 102b + 12c + 3d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Setting this equal to $2007$ and rearranging a bit yields</p><p><br/>$12c + 3d = 2007 - 1002a - 102b + 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c + d = 669 - 334a - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>(The reason for this slightly weird arrangement will soon become evident)</p><p><br/>Now we examine the possible values of $a$. If $a \\ge 3$, $n$ is already too large. $a$ must also be greater than $0$, or $n$ would be a $3$-digit number. Therefore, $a = 1 \\, \\text{or} \\, 2$. Now we examine by case.</p><p>If $a = 2$, then $b$ and $c$ must both be $0$ (otherwise $n$ would already be greater than $2007$). Substituting these values into the equation yields</p><p><br/>$d = 1 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{2 + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $d=1$.</p><p><br/>Sure enough, $2001 + (2+1) + 3=2007$.</p><p>Now we move onto the case where $a = 1$. Then our initial equation simplifies to</p><p><br/>$4c + d = 335 - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{1 + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p><br/>Since $c$ and $d$ can each be at most $9$, we substitute that value to find the lower bound of $b$. Doing so yields</p><p><br/>$34b \\ge 290 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{19 + b}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>The floor expression is at least $3\\lfloor\\frac{19}{10}\\rfloor=3$ , so the right-hand side is at least $293$. Solving for $b$, we see that $b \\ge 9$ $\\Rightarrow$ $b=9$. Again, we substitute for $b$ and the equation becomes</p><p><br/>$4c + d = 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{10 + c + d}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c + d = 32 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + d}{10}\\rfloor$.</p><p><br/>Just like we did for $b$, we can find the lower bound of $c$ by assuming $d = 9$ and solving:</p><p><br/>$4c + 9 \\ge 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p>$\\Rightarrow$ $4c \\ge 20 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor$</p><p><br/>The right hand side is $20$ for $c=0$ and $23$ for $c \\ge 1$. Solving for c yields $c \\ge 6$. Looking back at the previous equation, the floor expression is $0$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $3$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. Thus, the right-hand side is $32$ for $c+d \\le 9$ and $35$ for $c+d \\ge 10$. We can solve these two scenarios as systems of equations/inequalities:</p><p>$4c+d = 32$</p><p>$c+d \\le 9$</p><p>and</p><p>$4c+d=35$</p><p>$c+d \\ge 10$</p><p>Solving yields three pairs $(c, d):$ $(8, 0)$; $(8, 3)$; and $(7, 7)$. Checking the numbers $1980$, $1983$, and $1977$; we find that all three work. Therefore there are a total of $4$ possibilities for $n$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.</p><p>Note: Although this solution takes a while to read (as well as to write) the actual time it takes to think through the process above is very short in comparison to the solution length.</p><p>~edits by vadava_lx</p>"
