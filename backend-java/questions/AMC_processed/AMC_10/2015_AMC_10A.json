      "solutions": [
        "<p>Let Claudia have $x$ 5-cent coins and $\\left( 12 - x \\right)$ 10-cent coins. It is easily observed that any multiple of $5$ between $5$ and $5x + 10(12 - x) = 120 - 5x$ inclusive can be obtained by a combination of coins. Thus, $24 - x = 17$ combinations can be made, so $x = 7$. But the answer is not $7,$ because we are asked for the number of 10-cent coins, which is $12 - 7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$ ~kurt</p>",
        "<p>Since the coins are 5-cent and 10-cent, all possible values that can be made will be multiples of $5.$ To have exactly 17 different multiples of $5,$ we will need to make up to $85$ cents. There are two solutions from here:</p><p>1. Hare and Chicken approach</p><p>We assume that the 12 coins are all 10-cent coins. The sum will now be (12)(10) which is 120. 120 is 35 more than 85, and every 10-cent coin we switch for a 5-cent one will reduce the sum by 10-5=5 cents. Since 35/5=7, we will need to switch 7 10-cent coins for 5-cent ones, meaning we will have 7 5-cent coins and 12-7=5 10-cent coins. Therefore, the correct answer is answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$</p><p><br/>2. Algebra approach</p><p>We assume we have (x) 5-cent coins and (12-x)10-cent coins. Then we have the algebra formula 5x+10(12-x)=85 Simplyfying that, we get 120-5x=85, 5x=35, x=7. And since x is the number of 5-cent coins, the number of 10-cent coins is 12-x or 12-7=5. Therefore, the correct answer is answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$</p><p>-Alina</p>",
        "<p>Notice that for every $d$ dimes, any multiple of $5$ less than or equal to $10d + 5(12-d)$ is a valid arrangement. Since there are $17$ in our case, we have $10d + 5(12-d)=17 \\cdot 5 \\Rightarrow d=5$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$.</p><p>~MrThinker</p>",

        "<p>The rotation factor of the arrow is the sum of the rates of the regular rotation of the arrow (360\u00b0 every 360\u00b0 rotation = 1) and the rotation of the disk around the clock with twice the circumference (360\u00b0 every 180\u00b0 = 2). Thus, the rotation factor of the arrow is 3, and so our answer corresponds to 360\u00b0/3 = 120\u00b0, which is 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$</p>",
        "<p>The arrow travels a path of radius 30 (20 from the interior clock and 10 from the radius of the disk itself).

        "<p>We can approach this problem with angle measures. As the circumference of the disk is $10\\pi,$ and the clock $20 \\pi,$ we have that 30 degrees, or the angular measure between hours, of the disk is only 15 degrees of the clock. This yields that every two hour ticks that the clock rotates, on the third one, the ticks will meet. However, the disk must rotate 360 degrees in order to come back to its original position, so the angular measure that the disk has covered relative to the clock is simply $12 \\cdot 15 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3},$ or $120^\\circ$ from the 12 starting point, so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.</p><p>~ab2024</p>",
        "<p>If the big clock were a flat plane, then the smaller clock could travel $\\dfrac{40\\pi}{20\\pi}=2$ full revolutions.</p><p>But we also need to account for rotation. If we mark a red dot on the bottom of the small clock/bottom of the arrow, and then drag it around the clock, the direction of the arrow would still change. After traveling around the big clock, the small clock would travel $1$ full rotation.</p><p>Considering these two movements, the small clock travels 3 full rotations around the big clock so the arrow is next pointing upwards at $\\dfrac{12 \\text{ o'clock}}{3}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.</p><p>~BakedPotato66</p>",
        "<p>The center of rotation is in the center of the smaller circle, but extends to the center of the larger circle. That means the circumference of the circle in relation to the arrow is $60 \\pi$. The other circle is $20 \\pi$ and so that is $\\frac{1}{3}$. So $\\frac{12}{3} = 4$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$.</p>",
        "<p>Let the center of the disk be Planet X with orbit eccentricity $0$ and the center of the clock be the Sun.

Because $CT^{2} + DT^{2} = 2\\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\sqrt{2}\\right)^{2} = CD^{2}$, it follows that the $CTD$ is a right triangle, meaning that $\\angle CTD = 90^\\circ$, and it follows that planes $ABC$ and $ABD$ are perpendicular to each other. Now, we can treat $ABC$ as the base of the tetrahedron and $TD$ as the height. Thus, the desired volume is \\[V = \\dfrac{1}{3} bh = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\cdot[ABC]\\cdot TD = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\dfrac{12}{5} = \\dfrac{24}{5}\\] which is answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\dfrac{24}{5}}$</p>",

        "<p>Divide the boundary of the square into halves, thereby forming $8$ segments. Without loss of generality, let the first point $A$ be in the bottom-left segment. Then, it is easy to see that any point in the $5$ segments not bordering the bottom-left segment will be distance at least $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ apart from $A$. Now, consider choosing the second point on the bottom-right segment. The probability for it to be distance at least $0.5$ apart from $A$ is $\\dfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ because of linearity of the given probability. (Alternatively, one can set up a coordinate system and use geometric probability.)</p><p>If the second point $B$ is on the left-bottom segment, then if $A$ is distance $x$ away from the left-bottom vertex, then $B$ must be up to $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2}$ away from the left-middle point. Thus, using an averaging argument we find that the probability in this case is\\[\\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2} \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2} dx = 4\\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]</p><p>(Alternatively, one can equate the problem to finding all valid $(x, y)$ with $0 < x, y < \\dfrac{1}{2}$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\ge \\dfrac{1}{4}$, i.e. $(x, y)$ is outside the unit circle with radius $0.5.$)</p><p>Thus, averaging the probabilities gives\\[P = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( 5 + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 26 - \\pi \\right).\\]</p><p>Thus our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 59}$.</p><p>~minor edit by <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Yiyj1\" title=\"User:Yiyj1\">Yiyj1</a></p>",
        "<p>Let one point be chosen on a fixed side. Then the probability that the second point is chosen on the same side is $\\frac{1}{4}$, on an adjacent side is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and on the opposite side is $\\frac{1}{4}$. We discuss these three cases. </p><p>Case 1: Two points are on the same side. Let the first point be $a$ and the second point be $b$ in the $x$-axis with $0\\le a, b\\le 1$. Consider $(a, b)$ a point on the unit square $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$ on the Cartesian plane. The region $\\{(a,b): |b-a|> \\frac{1}{2}\\}$ has the area of $(\\frac{1}{2})^2$. Therefore, the probability that $|b-a|> \\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$. </p><p>Case 2: Two points are on two adjacent sides. Let the two sides be $[0,1]$ on the x-axis and $[0,1]$ on the y-axis and let one point be $(a, 0)$ and the other point be $(0, b)$. Then $0\\le a, b\\le 1$ and the distance between the two points is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. As in Case 1, $(a, b)$ is a point on the unit square $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$. The area of the region $\\{(a,b): \\sqrt{a^2+b^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}, 0\\le a, b\\le 1\\}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{16}$ and the area of its complementary set inside the square (i.e. $\\{(a,b): \\sqrt{a^2+b^2} > 1/2, 0\\le a, b\\le 1\\}$ ) is $1-\\frac{\\pi}{16}$. Therefore, the probability that the distance between $(a, 0)$ and $(0, b)$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $1-\\frac{\\pi}{16}$. </p><p>Case 3: Two points are on two opposite sides. In this case, the probability that the distance between the two points is at least $1/2$ is obviously $1$. </p><p>Thus the probability that the probability that the distance between the two points is at least $1/2$ is given by \\[\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4} =\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}.\\]Therefore $a=26$, $b=1$, and $c=32$.

        "<p>Let our points be called Point A and Point B. Let us first choose Point A to be on some side of the square. We have three cases:</p><p>Case 1: Point B is on the same side as Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}.$This is the standard geometric probability problem. Since Point A and Point B can be anywhere on the side, we can't really \"count\" all of the possibilities. Hence, we translate the problem to a problem involving areas, which can be a finite value while still \"containing\" infinitely many points. Let side of a square be a number line from $0$ to $1,$ and $a$ and $b$ be the values representing the positions of Point A and Point B respectively. Our problem now asks for the probability that $|a-b| \\geq 1/2.$ Graphing the inequality on a coordinate plane with $a$ and $b$ as the $x$ and $y$-axes gives us a \"good area\" of $1/4$ out of a \"total area\" of $1.$ Hence, the probability the inequality is satisfied is $1/4 \\div 1 = 1/4.$</p><p>Case 2: Point B is on a side adjacent to the side with Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}.$This is a slight deviation of the same geometric probability principle. This time, let the common vertex of the two sides be $0,$ and the sides have side length $1.$ Again, let $a$ and $b$ be the values representing the positions of Point A and Point B respectively, so the Pythagorean Theorem yields $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\geq 1/2,$ graphing into a quarter circle of radius $1/2,$ and a total area that is $1.$ Hence, our probability is $1-\\frac{\\pi(1/2)^2}{4} = \\frac{16-\\pi}{16}.$</p><p><br/>Case 3: Point B is on a side opposite to the side with Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}.$Clearly, the distance between Point A and Point B are at least 1, so it must be at least $1/2.$ The probability in this case is $1.$</p><p><br/>Now taking the probabilities of the setups into account, our final probability is \\[\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)+ \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\left(\\frac{16-\\pi}{16}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\left(1\\right)=\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}.\\]Thus $(a,b,c)=(26,1,32),$ so $a+b+c= \\boxed{\\mathbf{(A)}\\;59}$</p>"
