Their difference is $|1-0|=1$. Similarly, take take series $O$ and $E_2$. The first terms are $1$ and $2$. Their difference is $|1-2|=1$.

Now, we know 3 is the units digit of $M + M + 1$, so $M$ is either $1$ or $6$. Again, we must look at the digit before $M$, or $A$. $A$ is even, so $M$ must be less than $5$, or else the ten would be carried over. Ergo, $M$ is $1$.

        "<p>First, using given information, we can find the values of some line segments in the figure. We find that $HA = 10$ (through Pythagorean Theorem), $CH = 3$, and $EA = 5$. Let Line $FD = x$ and let Line $FG = y$. We find that $\\triangle FGE \\sim \\triangle CDE$ through some angle chasing (they both have a right angle, and they both share angle $\\angle CED$. Using this information, we can write the equation $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{4+x}{y}$. Through simplifying this equation, we get that $y=2x+8$. Let point $I$ be the point on line $FG$ so that lines $CI$ and $FG$ are perpendicular, and we get that $GI = 2x$ and $FI =8$. Doing some more angle chasing, we can find that $\\triangle GIH \\sim \\triangle GFA$, as they both share $\\angle FGH$ and they both have a right angle.</p><p>With this information, we can write the equation $\\frac{x+3}{y-8} = \\frac{x+9}{y}.$ Simplifying this equation we get the equation $-8x+6y-72 = 0$.Plugging in $y=2x+8$ for $6y$, we get $4x-24 = 0$, so $x=6$.Lastly, to find the value of y, which is the value of Line $FG$, our desired value, we plug in $6$ for $x$ in the equation $y=2x+8$, we get $2(6)+8$, which, finally, we get our $y$ value of $20$, so therefore, our answer is $GF= \\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}\\ 20}$</p><p>~Darth_Cadet</p><p><br/></p>",
        "<p>Draw a coordinate plane with the y-axis centered on $CD$ and the x-axis centered on $AD$. From there, call the line passing through $CE$ $a$ and the line passing through $HA$ $b$. From there, you can find that the equations for these lines are $y=-2x+8$ and $y=-4/3 x+12$ respectively. We need to find the length of $GF$, so we are finding the y-value of the point $G$. Solving for this point, we get $-4/3 x+12=-2x+8$;$2/3x=-4$;$x=-6$.
