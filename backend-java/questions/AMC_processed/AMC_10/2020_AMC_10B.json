This means the number of ways the rest $f_a$, $1<a<=k$ can be written by the scheme stated in the problem for each $f_1$ is equal to $D(96/f_1)$, since the product of $f_2 \\cdot f_3... \\cdot f_k=x$ is counted as one valid product if and only if $f_1 \\cdot x=96$, the product $x$ has the properties that factors are greater than $1$, and differently ordered products are counted separately.</p><p>For example, say the first factor is $2$.

        "<p>Consider how we partition the factors of $96 = 2^5\\cdot 3$. For each $k$, there are two cases. Either we can put the $2$s into $k$ nonzero parts, so that the $3$ shares a partition with some $2$s, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-(k-1)+(k-1)-1}{k-2} = k\\binom{4}{k-2}$ ways, or we can put the $2$s into $k-1$ nonzero parts and put the $3$ in its own partition, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-k+k-1}{k-1} = k\\binom{4}{k-1}$ ways. Summing over all $k$, we have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-2} + \\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-1}.\\]</p><p>But $\\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-2} = 2\\binom{4}{0}+3\\binom{4}{1} + \\dots + 6\\binom{4}{4} = 4 \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\binom{4}{i} = 4 \\cdot 2^4 = 64$. Similarly, $\\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-1} = 3\\cdot 2^4 = 48$. So our answer is $64+48 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$.</p><p>~InsetIowa9</p>",
