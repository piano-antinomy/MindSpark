So there are 2 ways to arrange 7 and 8 (because they can flip themselves) and 4 choose 2 ways to choose two numbers (out of 2, 3, 4, and 5) to go in the two spaces available on the leftmost column. Again, the remaining two numbers will be forced to go in only one way on the two spaces available on the top row, meaning there are also $12$ ways to make a chart with the middle number being 6. Example- 7 and 8 are in the bottom middle and right middle squares respectively and I chose 2 and 3 to be the numbers on the two spots on the leftmost column:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&4&5\\\\ \\hline 2&6&8\\\\ \\hline 3&7&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]</p><p>The case when the middle is 5 is the hardest case. The numbers 2, 3, and 4 will fill in spaces from the top left until the diagonal with 5, and either the top right or bottom left square will be left blank (no blanks before that because the box must increase). So there are 2 choices which one to leave blank:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&&\\\\ \\hline &5&\\\\ \\hline x&&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\;\\;\\; \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 1&&x\\\\ \\hline &5&\\\\ \\hline &&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]There are 3 choices for the box (either 2, 3, or 4) immediately next to the blank box between 1 and the blank box and the other 2 numbers (from 2, 3, or 4) will sort themselves. For example, if I chose the blank box to be the bottom left box and I chose the number immediately next to the blank box to be 2, the grid would look like this:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&3&4\\\\ \\hline 2&5&\\\\ \\hline &&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]Now there are 2 empty spaces in either the rightmost or the bottommost row (the row with the square you chose to be blank and 9) and 1 empty space in the middle of the other row with 9 and a value of 2, 3, or 4. Example- the two empty spaces are marked with an p and the one empty space in the other row is marked with a q:\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  \\hline 1&3&4\\\\ \\hline 2&5&q\\\\ \\hline p&p&9\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]Finally, pick either 6, 7, or 8 to fill the box marked q (the one empty space between a value of 2, 3, or 4) and the remaining two numbers from 6, 7 or 8 will sort itself in the two boxes marked with a p. This is 3 choose 1 = 3 ways. Thus, there are 2 ways to choose the blank box, 3 ways to choose the number (2, 3, or 4) between the blank box and 1, and 3 ways to choose the box on the opposite side of the number between the blank box and 1, and all the other numbers are forced to arrange themselves in 1 way. This means there are $2\\cdot3\\cdot3=18$ ways to make a chart with 5 in the middle.</p><p>The answer to the problem is $12+12+18 = \\boxed{\\text{(D) }42}$ ways to make a chart in total.</p><p>~unhappyfarmer</p>"

Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$, we get $m < 4$, which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$.

        "<p>Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders. We know that the Raiders and Wildcats both scored the same number of points in the first quarter so let $a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. The sum of the Raiders scores is $a(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3})$ and the sum of the Wildcats scores is $4a+6d$. Now we can narrow our search for the values of $a,d$, and $r$. Because points are always measured in positive integers, we can conclude that $a$ and $d$ are positive integers. We can also conclude that $r$ is a positive integer by writing down the equation:</p><p>\\[a(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3})=4a+6d+1\\]</p><p>Now we can start trying out some values of $r$.

        "<p>Raiders: $a, am, am^2, am^3$</p><p>Wildcats: $a, a + n, a + 2n, a + 3n,$</p><p>where $a$ represents both teams' score in the first quarter. Let the Raiders finish with a score of $r$. We know $4a + 6n + 1 = a(1 + m + m^2 + m^3) = r.$ Since $r \\le 100$, $1 + m + m^2 + m^3$ can either be $4, 15, 40,$ or $85$. Solve for $a$ in both equations in terms of $r$ and set them equal to each other:</p><p>$\\frac{r - (6n + 1)}{4} = \\frac{r}{1 + m + m^2 + m^3}.$ We know $1 + m + m^2 + m^3$ can't be $4$ because then $n$ would be a fraction. So let's try $15$:</p><p>$\\frac{r - (6n + 1)}{4} = \\frac{r}{15} \\implies 11r = 90n + 15.$ We know $r$ has to be a multiple of 15 for $a$ to be an integer. After some guess and check with the first few multiples of 15, we find that if $r = 75, n = 9.$ Then $a = 5$. Since this whole case is based on the fact $1 + m + m^2 + m^3 = 15, m = 2$.
