        "<p>The only way to get a total of $$20$ or more is if you pick a twenty and another bill, or if you pick both tens.

If we fix a number in a slot, then there are $4! = 24$ ways to arrange the other numbers, so each number appears in each spot $24$ times. Therefore, the sum of all such numbers is $24 \\times (1+3+5+7+8) \\times (11111) = 24 \\times 24 \\times 11111 = 6399936.$ Since there are $5! = 120$ such numbers, we divide $6399936 \\div 120$ to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }53332.8}$</p>",
        "<p>We can first solve for the mean for the digits $1, 3, 5, 7,$and $9$ since each is $2$ away from each other. The mean of the numbers than can be solved using these digits is $55555$. The total amount of numbers that can be formed using these digits is $5! =120$. The sum of these numbers is $55555(120) = 6666600$. Now we can find out the total value that was gained by replacing the $8$ with a $9$. We can start how be calculating the gain when the $8$ was in the ones digit. Since there are $4! = 24$ numbers with the $8$ in the ones digit and $1$ was gain from each of them, $24$ is the number gained. Then, we repeat this with the tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands place, leading to a total of $24+240+2400+24000+240000=266664$ as the total amount that was gained. Subtract this amount from the sum of the digits using the $9$ instead of the $8$ to get $6666600-266664=6399936$.

The maximum value of $a+b$ is $9+8=17$, so $a+b=11$. </p><p>Then, we have $33^2(a-b) = m^2$, so $a-b$ is a perfect square, but the only perfect squares that are within our bound on $a-b$ are $1$ and $4$.
