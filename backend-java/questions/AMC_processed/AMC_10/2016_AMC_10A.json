Notice also that 2016 is divisible by 3. This means if we can find a pattern for every even number that is divisible by 3, we can find the answer for 2016. The first three even numbers that are divisible by 3 from zero are 6, 12, and 18. There are 2 ways for 6, 3 ways for 12, and 4 ways for 18 (5 for 24, 6 for 30, and 7 for 36). The pattern here is that the number of ways for any even number X that is divisible by 36 is X/6 + 1. It turns out this pattern holds for every X number.

Let $x=2^a\\times 3^b\\times 5^c$, $y=2^d\\times 3^e\\times 5^f$ and $z=2^g\\times 3^h\\times 5^i$. We know that \\[\\max(a,d)=3\\] \\[\\max(b,e)=2\\] \\[\\max(a,g)=3\\] \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\] \\[\\max(c,i)=2\\] \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\] \\[\\max(e,h)=2\\] and $c=f=0$ since $\\text{lcm}(x,y)$ isn't a multiple of 5. Since $\\max(d,g)=2$ we know that $a=3$. We also know that since $\\max(b,h)=1$ that $e=2$. So now some equations have become useless to us...let's take them out. \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\] \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\] are the only two important ones left. We do casework on each now. If $\\max(b,h)=1$ then $(b,h)=(1,0),(0,1)$ or $(1,1)$. Similarly if $\\max(d,g)=2$ then $(d,g)=(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2)$. Thus our answer is $5\\times 3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}.$</p>",
