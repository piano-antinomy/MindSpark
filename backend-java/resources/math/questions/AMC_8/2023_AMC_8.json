If the analytic expression for line <INSERTION_INDEX_6> is <INSERTION_INDEX_7>, and the analytic expression for line <INSERTION_INDEX_8> is <INSERTION_INDEX_9>, we have equations: <INSERTION_INDEX_10> and <INSERTION_INDEX_11>. Solving these equations, we can find out that <INSERTION_INDEX_12> and <INSERTION_INDEX_13>. Therefore, we can determine that the expression for line <INSERTION_INDEX_14> is <INSERTION_INDEX_15> and the expression for line <INSERTION_INDEX_16> is <INSERTION_INDEX_17>. When <INSERTION_INDEX_18>, the coordinates that line <INSERTION_INDEX_19> and line <INSERTION_INDEX_20> pass through are <INSERTION_INDEX_21> and <INSERTION_INDEX_22>, and <INSERTION_INDEX_23> lies perfectly on one vertex of the rectangle while the <INSERTION_INDEX_24> coordinate of <INSERTION_INDEX_25> is out of the range <INSERTION_INDEX_26> (lower than the bottom left corner of the rectangle <INSERTION_INDEX_27>). Considering that the <INSERTION_INDEX_28> value of the line <INSERTION_INDEX_29> will only decrease, and the <INSERTION_INDEX_30> value of the line <INSERTION_INDEX_31> will only increase, there will not be another point on the rectangle that lies on either of the two lines. Thus, we can conclude that the answer is <INSERTION_INDEX_32></p><p>~<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/User:Bloggish\" title=\"User:Bloggish\">Bloggish</a></p>",

We can do this by making more of our moves the <INSERTION_INDEX_9> move turn than the <INSERTION_INDEX_10> move turn. The first obvious step is to go some amount of moves in the right direction then subtract off in the left direction to land on <INSERTION_INDEX_11>. The least amount of <INSERTION_INDEX_12>’s added to <INSERTION_INDEX_13> to make a multiple of <INSERTION_INDEX_14> is <INSERTION_INDEX_15> as <INSERTION_INDEX_16>. So now, we have solved the problem as we just go <INSERTION_INDEX_17> hops right, and just do 4 more hops left. Yielding <INSERTION_INDEX_18> as our answer.</p><p>~apex304, SohumUttamchandani, wuwang2002, TaeKim, Cxrupptedpat</p>",

We know that the numbers <INSERTION_INDEX_3>, <INSERTION_INDEX_4>, and <INSERTION_INDEX_5> must belong in different sets, as putting any <INSERTION_INDEX_6> numbers in <INSERTION_INDEX_7> set will either pass or match the limit of <INSERTION_INDEX_8> per set, and we would then still need to add <INSERTION_INDEX_9> more number after that. Note that these numbers must be distinct, as Alina only has <INSERTION_INDEX_10> of each number, and order does not matter in the sets. Starting with the set that includes the number <INSERTION_INDEX_11>, the next two numbers must add up to <INSERTION_INDEX_12>, and there are <INSERTION_INDEX_13> ways of doing this <INSERTION_INDEX_14>. Note we cannot use any number past <INSERTION_INDEX_15>, as those numbers must be used in the other sets. The next set, which includes the number <INSERTION_INDEX_16>, must have two numbers that add up to <INSERTION_INDEX_17>, and there are <INSERTION_INDEX_18> ways to do this <INSERTION_INDEX_19>.

Now we have found the number of ways in which each set sums up to <INSERTION_INDEX_25>. To find the number of ways in which all three sets sum up to <INSERTION_INDEX_26> concurrently, we must take the minimum of <INSERTION_INDEX_27>, <INSERTION_INDEX_28>, and <INSERTION_INDEX_29>, which gives us an answer of <INSERTION_INDEX_30> triplets of sets with 3 values, in which each set sum to the same amount. </p><p>~Fernat123</p>",

If you have closely studied magic squares, you might know that in a three by three magic square that is to be filled in with the integers <INSERTION_INDEX_4> through <INSERTION_INDEX_5>, the center of the square would be <INSERTION_INDEX_6> (the average of the numbers), and the numbers in the corners should be even(*). The such pairs (disregarding order) are <INSERTION_INDEX_7> and <INSERTION_INDEX_8> Let’s fix the position of <INSERTION_INDEX_9> to be the top left corner. This would make <INSERTION_INDEX_10> in the bottom right corner. We can have either <INSERTION_INDEX_11> or <INSERTION_INDEX_12> to be in the top right corner, for a total of <INSERTION_INDEX_13> such groups of three. (The groups are <INSERTION_INDEX_14> and <INSERTION_INDEX_15>)Note that if we had instead fixed the position of <INSERTION_INDEX_16>, <INSERTION_INDEX_17>, or <INSERTION_INDEX_18>, they would correspond to one of the two cases, just in a different configuration.</p><p><br/>(*)We can prove this using proof by contradiction. Label the nine small squares within the magic square from <INSERTION_INDEX_19> to <INSERTION_INDEX_20> from left to right, top to bottom. Firstly, we know that <INSERTION_INDEX_21> and <INSERTION_INDEX_22> sum to <INSERTION_INDEX_23> since the center square is <INSERTION_INDEX_24>. Thus, <INSERTION_INDEX_25> and <INSERTION_INDEX_26> must have the same parity, and so must <INSERTION_INDEX_27> and <INSERTION_INDEX_28>. Suppose that <INSERTION_INDEX_29> and <INSERTION_INDEX_30> have different parity. Since <INSERTION_INDEX_31>, <INSERTION_INDEX_32> must be even. By a similar argument, <INSERTION_INDEX_33> must also be even, and so must <INSERTION_INDEX_34> and <INSERTION_INDEX_35>. Our initial assumption is that one of <INSERTION_INDEX_36> and <INSERTION_INDEX_37> is odd and the other is even; however, we end up with six even numbers needed to fill in the square, but there are only four even integers from <INSERTION_INDEX_38> to <INSERTION_INDEX_39>. Now suppose that all of <INSERTION_INDEX_40> and <INSERTION_INDEX_41> are odd. This would make each of <INSERTION_INDEX_42> and <INSERTION_INDEX_43> odd, but clearly we do not have enough odd numbers to make all nine numbers odd. Thus, each corner square must be even.</p><p>~ Brian__Liu</p>",
