[cite: 201]</p><p>1. <b>Visualize the shape:</b><br>   - The original square is on a coordinate plane from (0,0) to (5,5).<br>   - The removed corners are squares of side 1 inch.<br>   - The remaining shape is a 5x5 square with the corners cut out. The shape's vertices are at (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (1,5), (1,4), and (0,4).</p><p>2. <b>Consider possible squares:</b><br>   - An 'upright' square (with sides parallel to the axes) could fit in the central 3x3 portion of the cross. The largest such square would be 3x3, with an area of 9.<br>   - A larger square might be fitted by tilting it.</p><p>3. <b>Find the largest tilted square:</b><br>   - By symmetry, the largest possible square will be centered at the center of the shape, which is (2.5, 2.5).<br>   - The vertices of this largest square will touch the outermost boundaries of the cross shape.<br>   - Let's test if a square whose vertices are the 'outer corners' of the cross-shape boundary is the largest possible square.<br>   - These 'outer corners' are the vertices of the remaining shape that are furthest from the center along the diagonals. The points are A=(1,0), B=(5,1), C=(4,5), and D=(0,4). Let's check if these four points form a square.<br><br>4. <b>Verify if ABCD is a square:</b><br>   - <b>Calculate side lengths (squared):</b><br>     $AB^2 = (5-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 4^2 + 1^2 = 17$.<br>     $BC^2 = (5-4)^2 + (1-5)^2 = 1^2 + (-4)^2 = 17$.<br>     $CD^2 = (4-0)^2 + (5-4)^2 = 4^2 + 1^2 = 17$.<br>     $DA^2 = (0-1)^2 + (4-0)^2 = (-1)^2 + 4^2 = 17$.<br>     All side lengths are equal ($\\sqrt{17}$).<br>   - <b>Check for perpendicular sides (using slopes):</b><br>     Slope of AB = $(1-0)/(5-1) = 1/4$.<br>     Slope of BC = $(5-1)/(4-5) = 4/(-1) = -4$.<br>     The product of the slopes is $(1/4) \\times (-4) = -1$, so $\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{BC}$.<br>   - Since the sides are equal and the adjacent sides are perpendicular, the shape formed by these vertices is a square.</p><p>5. <b>Calculate the area:</b><br>   The area of this square is the side length squared, which we already calculated as 17.</p><p>The area of the largest square that can be fitted is 17 square inches.</p>",
