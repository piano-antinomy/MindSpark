Let's classify the triangles by their side lengths.</p><ol><li><b>Large Equilateral Triangle:</b> The triangle {R, S, T} has side lengths (2, 2, 2). This is one type.</li><li><b>Small Equilateral Triangle:</b> The triangle formed by the three midpoints {X, Y, Z} is equilateral with side length 1. The triangles formed by one vertex and the two adjacent midpoints, like {R, Y, Z}, are also equilateral with side length 1. This gives a second type of triangle with side lengths (1, 1, 1).</li><li><b>Isosceles Triangle:</b> Consider a triangle formed by one vertex and two midpoints that are not both adjacent to it, for example {R, X, Y}. The side RY has length 1, side YX has length 1. The side RX is the median of $\\triangle RST$ to side ST, but from vertex R. Its length can be calculated. In an equilateral triangle with side 2, the median length is $\\sqrt{3}$. So, this triangle has side lengths (1, 1, $\\sqrt{3}$). This is a third type.</li><li><b>Scalene Triangle:</b> Consider a triangle formed by two vertices and one non-adjacent midpoint, for example {R, S, X}. The side RS has length 2. The side SX has length 1 (since X is midpoint of ST). The side RX has length $\\sqrt{3}$ (as calculated above). So, this triangle has side lengths (1, 2, $\\sqrt{3}$). This is a fourth type.</li></ol><p>By checking all possible combinations of three points, we find that every possible triangle falls into one of these four congruent classes.
