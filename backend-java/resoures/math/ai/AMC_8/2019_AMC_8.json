      "text": "<p>To identify the correct graph, we must translate the story of the race into graphical features on a distance-versus-time plot.</p><p><b>1. Analyze the Tortoise's motion:</b><br>The tortoise 'walks at a slow steady pace for the entire race'. On a distance-time graph, a steady pace is represented by a <b>straight line with a constant positive slope</b>. Since the pace is slow, the slope of this line should be relatively gentle.</p><p><b>2. Analyze the Hare's motion:</b><br>The hare's race has three parts:<br>   - 'quickly runs ahead': This is a line segment with a <b>steep positive slope</b>.<br>   - 'stops to take a nap': During a nap, time passes but distance from the start does not change. This is represented by a <b>horizontal line segment</b> (zero slope).<br>   - 'awakes and runs to the finish line': This is another line segment with a <b>steep positive slope</b>.</p><p><b>3. Analyze the Race Outcome:</b><br>The hare finds 'the tortoise already there', which means the tortoise won. Graphically, the tortoise's line must reach the finish distance (the maximum y-value) at an earlier time (a smaller x-value) than the hare's line does.</p><p><b>4. Evaluate the Graphs:</b><br>   - Graphs A, B, and D show the hare (the piecewise line) finishing before the tortoise (the straight line), which contradicts the story.<br>   - Graph E shows the tortoise's pace changing, which contradicts the 'steady pace' description.<br>   - <b>Graph C</b> correctly shows the tortoise as a single straight line and the hare as a three-part line (steep, flat, steep). Crucially, the tortoise's line reaches the finish line at a time before the hare's line does. This graph perfectly matches all details of the story.</p>",

      "text": "<p>To determine the color opposite the yellow face, we must deduce the cube's layout by analyzing the relationships between the faces shown in the three views. Each view shows three faces that meet at a single corner.</p><p><b>1. Identify the faces in each view:</b><br>   - <b>View 1:</b> A corner is shared by {Purple, Red, Green} faces.<br>   - <b>View 2:</b> A corner is shared by {Purple, Black, Green} faces.<br>   - <b>View 3:</b> A corner is shared by {White, Red, Green} faces.</p><p><b>2. Deduce the first pair of opposite faces:</b><br>   - Let's compare View 1 and View 2. Both views show faces that are adjacent to the edge where Purple and Green meet.<br>   - In View 1, the face next to the Purple-Green edge is <b>Red</b>.<br>   - In View 2, the face next to the Purple-Green edge is <b>Black</b>.<br>   - Since Red and Black are on opposite sides of this common edge, they must be opposite faces on the cube.

Both views show faces that are adjacent to the edge where Red and Green meet.<br>   - In View 1, the face next to the Red-Green edge is <b>Purple</b>.<br>   - In View 3, the face next to the Red-Green edge is <b>White</b>.<br>   - Since Purple and White are on opposite sides of this common edge, they must be opposite faces. So, <b>Purple is opposite White</b>.</p><p><b>4. Identify the final pair:</b><br>The six colors are Red, White, Green, Purple, Yellow, and Black. We have found two opposite pairs:<br>   - (Red, Black)<br>   - (Purple, White)<br>The only two colors remaining are Green and Yellow. Therefore, they must be the third pair of opposite faces.
