Let's analyze each option by considering the possible range of values.</p><p><b>(A) $y+x^2$</b>: Since $0 < x < 1$, we have $0 < x^2 < 1$. We also have $-1 < y < 0$. If we take $y$ close to -1 (e.g., $y = -0.9$) and $x^2$ close to 0 (e.g., $x=0.1$, so $x^2=0.01$), the sum $y+x^2 = -0.9 + 0.01 = -0.89$ is negative. So, this is not necessarily positive.</p><p><b>(B) $y+xz$</b>: Since $0 < x < 1$ and $1 < z < 2$, their product $xz$ is in the range $0 < xz < 2$. Again, if we take $y$ close to -1 (e.g., $y=-0.9$) and $xz$ close to 0 (e.g., $x=0.1, z=1.1$, so $xz=0.11$), the sum $y+xz = -0.9 + 0.11 = -0.79$ is negative. Not necessarily positive.</p><p><b>(C) $y+y^2$</b>: We can factor this as $y(1+y)$. Since $-1 < y < 0$, the term $y$ is negative. For the term $(1+y)$, adding 1 to the inequality gives $0 < 1+y < 1$, so $(1+y)$ is positive. The product of a negative number and a positive number is always negative. So, this expression is necessarily negative.</p><p><b>(D) $y+2y^2$</b>: We can factor this as $y(1+2y)$. The term $y$ is negative. For $(1+2y)$, we multiply the inequality for $y$ by 2: $-2 < 2y < 0$. Then add 1: $-1 < 1+2y < 1$. The term $(1+2y)$ can be positive or negative. For example, if $y=-0.6$, $1+2y = -0.2$, and the product is positive. But if $y=-0.4$, $1+2y=0.2$, and the product is negative. Not necessarily positive.</p><p><b>(E) $y+z$</b>: We have the inequalities $-1 < y < 0$ and $1 < z < 2$. We can add these inequalities directly: <br>$(-1) + 1 < y+z < 0 + 2$<br>$0 < y+z < 2$<br>This shows that the expression $y+z$ is always greater than 0. Thus, it is necessarily positive.</p>",
