Rerolling 1 die (if possible) is always better than rerolling 2 dice (max prob 5/36). Therefore, Jason only considers rerolling 2 dice if it's impossible to reroll 1. This means for his initial roll $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$, every pair must sum to more than 6. Sorting the dice $d_1 \\le d_2 \\le d_3$, this means $d_1+d_2 > 6$.</p><p>Next, rerolling 2 must be better than rerolling 3. The best he can do by rerolling 2 is to keep the smallest die, $d_1$. The win prob is $W(7-d_1)/36$. This must be greater than the prob of rerolling 3, which is $5/72$.</p><p>$W(7-d_1)/36 > 5/72 \\implies 2W(7-d_1) > 5 \\implies W(7-d_1) \\ge 3$.</p><p>From the distribution of two-dice sums, $W(K) \\ge 3$ for $K \\in \\{4,5,6,7,...\\}$.
