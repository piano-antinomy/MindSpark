Since $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, we can place D on the y-axis and B on the x-axis.</p><ul><li>$C = (0,0)$</li><li>Let $BC=x$, so $B=(x,0)$.</li><li>Since $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$ and $AB=2$, $A=(x,2)$.</li><li>Let $CD=y$, so $D=(0,y)$.</li></ul><p>We are given that all side lengths are positive integers, so $x=BC$ and $y=CD$ must be positive integers.</p><p>We are also given that $AD=CD$, so $AD=y$. We can calculate the length of AD using the distance formula for points $A(x,2)$ and $D(0,y)$:</p><p>$AD^2 = (x-0)^2 + (2-y)^2 = x^2 + (y-2)^2$.</p><p>Since $AD^2 = y^2$, we have:</p><p>$y^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 4$</p><p>$0 = x^2 - 4y + 4$</p><p>$x^2 = 4y - 4 = 4(y-1)$</p><p>Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x^2$ is a perfect square. For $4(y-1)$ to be a perfect square, $(y-1)$ must also be a perfect square. Let $y-1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$.</p><p>Since $x=BC$ must be a positive integer, $x^2>0$, so $y-1>0$, which means $y>1$. Thus $k$ must be a positive integer, $k \\ge 1$.</p><p>From this we can express the side lengths in terms of $k$:</p><ul><li>$y = k^2 + 1$</li><li>$x^2 = 4k^2 \\implies x = 2k$ (since $x>0$)</li></ul><p>The side lengths are $AB=2, BC=2k, CD=k^2+1, AD=k^2+1$. They are all integers for any integer $k \\ge 1$.</p><p>The perimeter $p$ is the sum of the side lengths:</p><p>$p = AB+BC+CD+AD = 2 + 2k + (k^2+1) + (k^2+1) = 2k^2 + 2k + 4$.</p><p>We need to find how many different values of $p$ are possible for $p < 2015$. This is equivalent to finding how many integer values of $k \\ge 1$ satisfy the inequality:</p><p>$2k^2 + 2k + 4 < 2015$</p><p>$2k^2 + 2k - 2011 < 0$</p><p>To find for which $k$ this holds, we find the positive root of $2k^2+2k-2011=0$.</p><p>$k = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(2)(-2011)}}{4} = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{4+16088}}{4} = \\frac{-2+\\sqrt{16092}}{4}$.</p><p>We know $120^2=14400$ and $130^2=16900$. Let's test $127^2 = 16129$. So $\\sqrt{16092}$ is slightly less than 127.</p><p>$k \\approx \\frac{-2+126.something}{4} \\approx \\frac{124.something}{4} \\approx 31.something$.</p><p>So we need $k < 31.something$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $k$ is 31. Let's check:</p><ul><li>If $k=31$: $p = 2(31^2)+2(31)+4 = 2(961)+62+4 = 1922+66 = 1988 < 2015$.</li><li>If $k=32$: $p = 2(32^2)+2(32)+4 = 2(1024)+64+4 = 2048+68 = 2116 > 2015$.</li></ul><p>So $k$ can be any integer from 1 to 31. Since the perimeter $p(k)=2k^2+2k+4$ is a strictly increasing function for $k>0$, each value of $k$ gives a unique value of $p$.</p><p>Thus, there are <b>31</b> possible values for $p$.</p>",
