Since $n$ is a positive integer, $10^n-1 \\neq 0$, so we can divide the entire equation by $\\frac{10^n-1}{9}$:</p><p>$c(10^n+1) - b = a^2 \\frac{10^n-1}{9}$</p><p>Now, rearrange the terms to isolate $10^n$:</p><p>$9c(10^n+1) - 9b = a^2(10^n-1)$</p><p>$9c \\cdot 10^n + 9c - 9b = a^2 \\cdot 10^n - a^2$</p><p>$(9c - a^2)10^n = 9b - 9c - a^2$</p><p>This equation must hold for at least two different values of $n$. If the coefficient of $10^n$, $(9c-a^2)$, were not zero, then $10^n$ would be equal to a fixed constant, which is impossible for two different $n$. Therefore, both sides of the equation must be zero.</p><p>1) $9c - a^2 = 0 \\implies a^2 = 9c$</p><p>2) $9b - 9c - a^2 = 0$</p><p>From (1), since $a$ and $c$ are non-zero digits ($1..9$), $a^2$ must be a multiple of 9. The possible values for $a^2$ are $9, 36, 81$.</p><ul><li>If $a^2=9$, $a=3$. Then $9c=9 \\implies c=1$.</li><li>If $a^2=36$, $a=6$. Then $9c=36 \\implies c=4$.</li><li>If $a^2=81$, $a=9$. Then $9c=81 \\implies c=9$.</li></ul><p>From (2), substitute $a^2=9c$: $9b - 9c - 9c = 0 \\implies 9b = 18c \\implies b = 2c$.</p><p>Now we find the possible values for $(a,b,c)$ and $a+b+c$ for each case:</p><ul><li><b>Case 1:</b> $c=1, a=3$. Then $b=2c=2$. This gives $(a,b,c) = (3,2,1)$, which are all valid digits. $a+b+c = 3+2+1=6$.</li><li><b>Case 2:</b> $c=4, a=6$. Then $b=2c=8$. This gives $(a,b,c) = (6,8,4)$, which are all valid digits. $a+b+c = 6+8+4=18$.</li><li><b>Case 3:</b> $c=9, a=9$. Then $b=2c=18$. This is not a valid digit for $b$.</li></ul><p>The possible values for $a+b+c$ are 6 and 18. The greatest possible value is 18.</p>",
