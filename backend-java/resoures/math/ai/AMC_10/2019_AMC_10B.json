  $T,M,H$ are digits. $0 \le T+M+H \le 27$.
  $T+M+H \equiv 3 \pmod{9} \implies T+M+H \in \{3, 12, 21\}$.
  $T-M-H \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$. Let $K = T+M+H$. Then $M+H=K-T$.
  $T-(K-T) \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T - K \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$.
  Let's test the possible values for K:
  If K=3: $2T-3 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \implies T \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$. So $T=5$. Then $M+H = K-T=3-5=-2$. Impossible.
  If K=12: $2T-12 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T-1 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T \equiv 8 \pmod{11} \implies T \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$. So $T=4$. Then $M+H = K-T=12-4=8$.
  If K=21: $2T-21 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T-10 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \implies 2T \equiv 17 \pmod{11} \implies 2T \equiv 6 \pmod{11} \implies T \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$. So $T=3$. Then $M+H = K-T=21-3=18$. This means $M=9, H=9$.
  We have two possibilities: ($T=4, M+H=8$) or ($T=3, M=9, H=9$).
  But we know $H=0$.
  The first case gives $T=4, M+0=8 \implies M=8$. The digits are $T=4, M=8, H=0$.
  The second case requires $H=9$, which contradicts $H=0$.
  So the only solution is $T=4, M=8, H=0$.
  The sum is $T+M+H = 4+8+0 = 12$.</p>",

Since $\\epsilon_n > 0$, this ratio is always less than 1, so the sequence $\{x_n\}$ is monotonically decreasing and converges to 4.</p><p>For small values of $\\epsilon_n$ (i.e., for large $n$), the ratio $\\frac{\\epsilon_{n+1}}{\\epsilon_n} \\approx \\frac{9}{10}$. So, $\\epsilon_n \\approx (0.9)^n \\epsilon_0 = (0.9)^n$.</p><p>We need to find the least positive integer $m$ such that $x_m \\le 4+\\frac{1}{2^{20}}$. This is equivalent to finding the least $m$ such that $\\epsilon_m \\le \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$.</p><p>Using our approximation, we need to solve $(0.9)^m \\le \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$.</p><p>Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:</p><p>$m \\ln(0.9) \\le -20 \\ln(2)$.</p><p>$m (\\ln(9)-\\ln(10)) \\le -20 \\ln(2)$.</p><p>$m (2\\ln(3) - (\\ln(2)+\\ln(5))) \\le -20 \\ln(2)$.</p><p>Since $\\ln(0.9)$ is negative, we reverse the inequality when dividing:</p><p>$m \\ge \\frac{-20 \\ln(2)}{\\ln(0.9)} = \\frac{20 \\ln(2)}{-\\ln(0.9)} = \\frac{20 \\ln(2)}{\\ln(10/9)}$.</p><p>Using approximations $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$ and $\\ln(10/9) = \\ln(1.111...) \\approx 0.105$:</p><p>$m \\ge \\frac{20 \\times 0.693}{0.105} \\approx \\frac{13.86}{0.105} \\approx 132$.</p><p>Let's refine the bounds. The ratio $\\frac{\\epsilon_{n+1}}{\\epsilon_n} = \\frac{\\epsilon_n+9}{\\epsilon_n+10}$ is always greater than $0.9$ and decreases towards $0.9$ as $\epsilon_n \to 0$. At the start, for $\epsilon_0=1$, the ratio is $10/11 \approx 0.909$. So the error decreases slightly faster than $(0.9)^n$ initially.</p><p>Let's check the bounds using the ratio bounds: $0.9 < \\frac{\\epsilon_{n+1}}{\\epsilon_n} < \frac{10}{11}$.</p><p>This gives $(0.9)^m \\epsilon_0 < \\epsilon_m < (10/11)^m \\epsilon_0$. With $\\epsilon_0=1$:</p><p>We need $\epsilon_m \\le 1/2^{20}$.</p><p>A lower bound for $m$: $(10/11)^m \\approx 1/2^{20} \\implies m \\ge \\frac{20 \\ln(2)}{\\ln(11/10)} \\approx \\frac{13.86}{0.0953} \\approx 145.4$.</p><p>A upper bound for $m$: $(0.9)^m \\approx 1/2^{20} \\implies m \\approx 132$.</p><p>The value of $m$ is likely between 132 and 145. Both values fall into the interval [81, 242].</p>",
