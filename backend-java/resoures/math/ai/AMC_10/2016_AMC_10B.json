Let's explore the first case.</p><p>$N_1 = 1ab$ and $N_2=2cd$. $1ab+2cd=400$ is not possible as $100+200=300$. Let's try $N_1=1ab$ and $N_2=2cd$. S = $N_1+N_2$.

The sum must be at least $103+245 = 348$. A sum in the 300s is possible. However, to get a sum like 301, we would need $N_1+N_2 = 301$, which would require the hundreds digits to be 1 and 2 (no carry), but then the tens digits would need to sum to 0 or 10, which is hard with distinct digits without creating a carry. The sum of 400 is achievable and gives a digit sum of 4. Any smaller digit sum (1, 2, 3) is not possible as S must be greater than 300.</p>",

My original analysis missed 5678. $a=5 \implies 64=8c+d$. $c=8,d=0$ (5680) works. $c=7,d=8$ gives $10(5)+8(7)+8=50+56+8=114$. This is correct. $ab=56, bc=67, cd=78$. This is increasing with $k=11$.
