The Given Circles:</b></p><ul><li>$C_1: x^2+y^2=4$ (center (0,0), radius $r_1=2$)</li><li>$C_2: x^2+y^2=64$ (center (0,0), radius $r_2=8$)</li><li>$C_3: (x-5)^2+y^2=3$ (center (5,0), radius $r_3=\\sqrt{3}$)</li></ul><p><b>2. Condition for Tangency to $C_1$ and $C_2$:</b> Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are concentric, any circle $C$ tangent to both must have its center on a circle centered at the origin. We analyze the types of tangency:</p><ul><li><b>Case A:</b> $C$ is in the ring between $C_1$ and $C_2$. For a circle with radius $r$, its center's distance from the origin must be $2+r$ (for external tangency to $C_1$) and $8-r$ (for internal tangency to $C_2$). Setting these equal gives $2+r=8-r \\implies 2r=6 \\implies r=3$. The centers of these solution circles must lie on a circle of radius $2+3=5$, i.e., $x^2+y^2=25$.</li><li><b>Case B:</b> $C$ is inside $C_2$ and contains $C_1$. The center's distance from the origin is $r-2$ and $8-r$. So $r-2=8-r \\implies 2r=10 \\implies r=5$. The centers must lie on a circle of radius $r-2=3$, i.e., $x^2+y^2=9$.</li></ul><p><b>3. Condition for Tangency to $C_3$:</b> The distance from the center $(x,y)$ of a solution circle to the center of $C_3$, $(5,0)$, must be $|r \\pm r_3|$.</p><ul><li>For Case A ($r=3$, centers on $x^2+y^2=25$): We solve the system of equations. This leads to four distinct solutions for the center $(x,y)$. Thus, there are **four** solution circles with radius 3.</li><li>For Case B ($r=5$, centers on $x^2+y^2=9$): Solving this system similarly leads to another four distinct solutions for the center. Thus, there are **four** solution circles with radius 5.</li></ul><p><b>4. Sum of the Areas:</b> In total, there are 8 solution circles: four with radius 3 and four with radius 5. The sum of their areas is:</p><p>$Sum = 4 \\times (\\pi \\cdot 3^2) + 4 \\times (\\pi \\cdot 5^2)$</p><p>$Sum = 4(9\\pi) + 4(25\\pi) = 36\\pi + 100\\pi = 136\\pi$.</p>",

Amelia's Stopping Rule:</b> Amelia performs up to 3 steps. Let $t_n$ be the duration of step $n$, where $t_n$ is chosen uniformly from $(0,1)$. She stops after step $n$ if the total time $T_n = t_1 + \\dots + t_n$ has exceeded 1.

Sums of Uniform Variables:</b></p><ul><li>$P(x_1+x_2 > 1)$: For two $U(0,1)$ variables, this probability is a standard result of $1/2$.</li><li>$P(x_1+x_2+x_3 > 1)$: For three $U(0,1)$ variables, it's easier to find the complement, $P(x_1+x_2+x_3 \\le 1)$. Geometrically, this is the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) inside a unit cube. The volume is $1/6$.
