Let $P=(3,4), Q=(-4,-3)$. Let $R=(4,3), S=(-3,4)$. $R$ and $S$ are distinct from P and Q. The squared distance $RS^2 = (4-(-3))^2+(3-4)^2 = 7^2+(-1)^2=50$. This works. But we need the smallest RS. Let's choose $R=(-3,4)$ and $S=(-4,3)$. $RS^2=(-3-(-4))^2 + (4-3)^2 = 1^2+1^2=2$. These four points $P=(3,4)$, $Q=(-4,-3)$, $R=(-3,4)$, $S=(-4,3)$ are all distinct. So our choice is valid.</p>",
