This means the first and third columns are permutations of each other. Similarly, the first and third rows are permutations of each other.
  Let's choose the colors for the first row.
  $C_{11}$: 4 choices.
  $C_{12}$: 3 choices.
  $C_{13}$: Can be any of the 4 colors. Wait, no.
  Let's fill the $2 \times 2$ top left square.
  Number of ways to color $C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{21}, C_{22}$ with 4 distinct colors: $4! = 24$.
  Once these are set, say $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B \\\\ G & W \\end{pmatrix}$, let's see if the rest is determined.
  $C_{13}$ must complete $\{B, C_{13}, W, C_{23}\}$ to be the 4 colors. So $\{C_{13}, C_{23}\} = \{R, G\}$.
  $C_{31}$ must complete $\{G, C_{31}, W, C_{32}\}$ to be the 4 colors. So $\{C_{31}, C_{32}\} = \{R, B\}$.
  $C_{23}$ from $\{C_{12},C_{13},C_{22},C_{23}\}$. So $\{C_{12},C_{22},C_{13},C_{23}\} = \{B,W,C_{13},C_{23}\} = \{R,B,G,W\}$. Hence $\{C_{13},C_{23}\}=\{R,G\}$.
  $C_{32}$ from $\{C_{21},C_{22},C_{31},C_{32}\}$. So $\{C_{21},C_{22},C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{G,W,C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{R,B,G,W\}$. Hence $\{C_{31},C_{32}\}=\{R,B\}$.
  $C_{33}$ from $\{C_{22},C_{23},C_{32},C_{33}\}$. So $\{W, C_{23}, C_{32}, C_{33}\} = \{R,B,G,W\}$. Hence $\{C_{23},C_{32},C_{33}\}=\{R,B,G\}$.
  We have two choices for $C_{13}$ (R or G). Let's pick $C_{13}=R$. Then $C_{23}=G$.
  Now grid is $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & R \\\\ G & W & G \\\\ C_{31} & C_{32} & C_{33} \\end{pmatrix}$.
  From $\{C_{31}, C_{32}\} = \{R, B\}$, we have two choices. Let's pick $C_{31}=R, C_{32}=B$.
  Grid is $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & R \\\\ G & W & G \\\\ R & B & C_{33} \\end{pmatrix}$.
  Last square $\{W,G,B,C_{33}\}$ needs $C_{33}=R$.
  Final grid: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & R \\\\ G & W & G \\\\ R & B & R \\end{pmatrix}$. This fails the $2 \times 2$ rule. For example, bottom left $\{G,W,R,B\}$ is fine. Bottom right $\{W,G,B,R\}$ is fine. Top left $\{R,B,G,W\}$ is fine. Top right $\{B,R,W,G\}$ is fine. So this coloring works!
  So for each of the 24 initial choices for the top-left square, we had 2 choices for $(C_{13}, C_{23})$ and 2 choices for $(C_{31}, C_{32})$, and $C_{33}$ was determined.
  Let's check the other choices.
  Initial: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B \\\\ G & W \\end{pmatrix}$
  Choice 1: $C_{13}=R, C_{23}=G$. Then we need $\{C_{31}, C_{32}\} = \{R,B\}$.
     - Subcase 1a: $C_{31}=R, C_{32}=B$. Then $C_{33}$ must be $R$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & R \\\\ G & W & G \\\\ R & B & R \\end{pmatrix}$. (Works).
     - Subcase 1b: $C_{31}=B, C_{32}=R$. Then $C_{33}$ must be $G$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & R \\\\ G & W & G \\\\ B & R & G \\end{pmatrix}$. Fails, e.g. bottom-left $\{G,W,B,R\}$.
  Choice 2: $C_{13}=G, C_{23}=R$. Then we need $\{C_{31}, C_{32}\} = \{R,B\}$.
     - Subcase 2a: $C_{31}=R, C_{32}=B$. Then $C_{33}$ must be $B$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & G \\\\ G & W & R \\\\ R & B & B \\end{pmatrix}$. Fails.
     - Subcase 2b: $C_{31}=B, C_{32}=R$. Then $C_{33}$ must be $W$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B & G \\\\ G & W & R \\\\ B & R & W \\end{pmatrix}$. This one works!
  
  So, for each of the 24 initial colorings of the top-left square, there are 2 valid completions.
  Total number of colorings = $24 \\times 2 = 48$.
  
  Wait, there is a simpler way to count.
  Choose color for $C_{11}$ (4 ways). Choose color for $C_{12}$ (3 ways). Choose color for $C_{21}$ (2 ways). $C_{22}$ is forced (1 way). This is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$ ways to set the first row and column, which determines the grid.
  $C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{21}$ chosen. $C_{22}$ must be the 4th color.
  $C_{13}$ from $\{C_{11},C_{21}\}$. $C_{31}$ from $\{C_{11},C_{12}\}$.
  $C_{23}$ is determined by top right $2 \times 2$. $C_{32}$ is determined. $C_{33}$ is determined.
  Number of choices:
  $C_{11}$: 4 ways.
  $C_{12}$: 3 ways.
  $C_{21}$: 3 ways (must be different from $C_{11}$).
  $C_{22}$: 2 ways (must be different from $C_{12}, C_{21}$).
  $C_{13}, C_{31}, \dots$ are determined from the constraints.
  Let's try: $C_{11}=A, C_{12}=B, C_{21}=C, C_{22}=D$.
  $C_{13}$ must complete $\{B,D,C_{13},C_{23}\} = \{A,B,C,D\}$. $\{C_{13},C_{23}\}=\{A,C\}$.
  $C_{31}$ must complete $\{C,D,C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{A,B,C,D\}$. $\{C_{31},C_{32}\}=\{A,B\}$.
  From first and third column relation: $C_{13} = C_{21}=C$ and $C_{23}=C_{11}=A$.
  From first and third row relation: $C_{31} = C_{12}=B$ and $C_{32}=C_{11}=A$.
  $C_{33}$ must be $C_{22}=D$.
  This gives $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B & C \\\\ C & D & A \\\\ B & A & D \\end{pmatrix}$.
  Let's check this grid. TL: {A,B,C,D}. TR: {B,C,D,A}. BL: {C,D,B,A}. BR: {D,A,A,D} - fails!
  So the pattern must be different.
  The two working patterns are $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B & A \\\\ C & D & C \\\\ A & B & A \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & D \\\\ C & B & A \\end{pmatrix}$ let's re-verify.
  The number of choices for the first pattern type: $A, B, C, D$ can be chosen in $4!$ ways. $A, B$ can be swapped, and $A,C$ can be swapped. This is complex.
  
  Let's restart with the successful analysis.
  Ways to color top-left $2 \\times 2$ square: $4! = 24$.
  Let's fix it to $\\begin{pmatrix} R & B \\\\ G & W \\end{pmatrix}$.
  The rest of the grid is $\\begin{pmatrix} C_{13} & C_{23} \\\\ C_{31} & C_{32} \\\\ C_{33} & \\end{pmatrix}$.
  The constraints are: $\{C_{13},C_{23}\} = \{R,G\}$, $\{C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{R,B\}$, and $\{C_{23},C_{32},C_{33}\} = \{R,B,G\}$.
  Case 1: $C_{13}=R, C_{23}=G$. The third constraint becomes $\{G,C_{32},C_{33}\} = \{R,B,G\}$. So $\{C_{32},C_{33}\}=\{R,B\}$.
  Combined with $\{C_{31},C_{32}\}=\{R,B\}$, we have two subcases for $C_{32}$:
    a) $C_{32}=R$. Then $C_{33}=B$ and $C_{31}=B$. Grid: $\\begin{pmatrix} R&B&R \\ G&W&G \\ B&R&B \\end{pmatrix}$. Bottom left is $\{G,W,B,R\}$ (OK). Bottom right is $\{W,G,R,B\}$ (OK). This coloring works.
    b) $C_{32}=B$. Then $C_{33}=R$ and $C_{31}=R$. Grid: $\\begin{pmatrix} R&B&R \\ G&W&G \\ R&B&R \\end{pmatrix}$. This coloring works.
  Case 2: $C_{13}=G, C_{23}=R$. The third constraint becomes $\{R,C_{32},C_{33}\} = \{R,B,G\}$. So $\{C_{32},C_{33}\}=\{B,G\}$.
  Combined with $\{C_{31},C_{32}\}=\{R,B\}$, we have two subcases for $C_{32}$:
    a) $C_{32}=B$. Then $C_{33}=G$ and $C_{31}=R$. Grid: $\\begin{pmatrix} R&B&G \\ G&W&R \\ R&B&G \\end{pmatrix}$. This coloring works.
    b) $C_{32}=G$ is not in $\{R,B\}$. So this case is impossible.
  Something is wrong. My check for case 1a must be wrong. Let's recheck $\\begin{pmatrix} R&B&R \\ G&W&G \\ B&R&B \\end{pmatrix}$. First row has two R's. This violates no rules. The top-right $2 \\times 2$ is $\{B,R,W,G\}$. This is fine. The top-left $2 \\times 2$ is $\{R,B,G,W\}$. Ok.
  Total colorings from my last analysis: $24 \times 3 = 72$. This is an option.
  Let's look at the example given: $\\begin{pmatrix} G & R & B \\\\ B & G & R \\\\ R & B & G \\end{pmatrix}$. This doesn't follow any of my derived patterns.
  Let's check the example. Top-left: {G,R,B,G} - fails, two G's. The image in the PDF is just an example of a coloring, not necessarily a valid one. Ah, the image is for problem 20 but is placed weirdly. It's an example of a *valid* coloring. Let's re-read [177]. "One such coloring is shown on the right below."
  The example is: top row GRB, middle BGR, bottom RBG. The letters are from [182]-[188].
  Let's check it: $\\begin{pmatrix} G & R & B \\\\ B & G & R \\\\ R & B & G \\end{pmatrix}$.
  TL: $\{G,R,B,G\}$, Fails.
  The image must be mis-transcribed. Let's assume the letters BR, B, G, G, R, B, R mean something else.
  Let's trust my logic that for each of the $4!$ ways to color the top-left square, there are 3 ways to complete the grid. Total: $24 \times 3 = 72$.
  The three solutions for $\\begin{pmatrix}R&B\\G&W\\end{pmatrix}$ are: $\\begin{pmatrix}R&B&R\\G&W&G\\B&R&B\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix}R&B&R\\G&W&G\\R&B&R\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix}R&B&G\\G&W&R\\R&B&G\\end{pmatrix}$. Wait, my check on the last one was wrong. Recheck: $\{W,R,B,G\}$ OK. $\{G,R,R,B\}$ Fails. So only 2 solutions per initial setup.
  $24 \times 2 = 48$. This is an option.
  
  Final re-check: Start with $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix}$.
  $\{C_{13},C_{23}\}=\{A,C\}$, $\{C_{31},C_{32}\}=\{A,B\}$.
  Case 1: $C_{13}=A, C_{23}=C$. Grid so far: $\\begin{pmatrix} A&B&A \\ C&D&C \\ C_{31}&C_{32}&C_{33} \\end{pmatrix}$.
    Bottom-left $\{C,D,C_{31},C_{32}\} \implies \{C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{A,B\}$. This is consistent.
    Bottom-right $\{D,C,C_{32},C_{33}\} \implies \{C_{32},C_{33}\} = \{A,B\}$.
    So $C_{32}$ must be in $\{A,B\}$ and $\{A,B\}$.
    If $C_{32}=A$, then $C_{31}=B$ and $C_{33}=B$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} A&B&A \\ C&D&C \\ B&A&B \\end{pmatrix}$. Check this. Works.
    If $C_{32}=B$, then $C_{31}=A$ and $C_{33}=A$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} A&B&A \\ C&D&C \\ A&B&A \\end{pmatrix}$. Check this. Works.
  So 2 solutions here.
  Case 2: $C_{13}=C, C_{23}=A$. Grid so far: $\\begin{pmatrix} A&B&C \\ C&D&A \\ C_{31}&C_{32}&C_{33} \\end{pmatrix}$.
    BL $\{C,D,C_{31},C_{32}\} \implies \{C_{31},C_{32}\} = \{A,B\}$. Consistent.
    BR $\{D,A,C_{32},C_{33}\} \implies \{C_{32},C_{33}\} = \{B,C\}$.
    $C_{32}$ must be in $\{A,B\}$ and $\{B,C\}$. So $C_{32}=B$.
    Then $C_{31}=A$ and $C_{33}=C$. Result: $\\begin{pmatrix} A&B&C \\ C&D&A \\ A&B&C \\end{pmatrix}$. Check this. Works.
  Total of 3 solutions for each of the 24 top-left configs. Total $24 \times 3 = 72$.",

The distance from the center of the frame to the center of a block touching a side is the apothem of the frame, $A_F$. The blocks form a ring. The width of this ring is twice the apothem of a small block, which is $\\sqrt{3}$.

This is negative, which is impossible. My model of the geometry must be wrong.</p><p>The arrangement is described as 'each block lies along an inside edge'. This means one side of each block is collinear with a side of the frame. The distance from the frame's apothem to the block's apothem must be related.
  Let $A_F$ be the apothem of the frame and $a_b= \\sqrt{3}/2$ be the apothem of a block.
  The total structure has a central hole which is a regular hexagon of side 1. This is because the blocks are of side 1. The distance across the flats of this hole is $2a_b=\\sqrt{3}$.
  A block has thickness (distance across flats) of $\\sqrt{3}$.
  The distance across the flats of the whole frame is $A_F \\times 2$. This must be equal to the thickness of the central hole plus twice the thickness of a block: $\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$.
  So $2A_F = 3\\sqrt{3} \\implies A_F = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
  Side of frame $S$ is related to apothem by $A_F = S\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
  $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = S\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\implies S=3$.
  The given distance $d=3/7$ must be a check. Let's see. If $S=3$, a vertex is at $(3,0)$. A block sits on the side from $(3/2, 3\\sqrt{3}/2)$ to $(3,0)$. The vertices of this block are... this is getting too complicated.
  Let's reconsider the relation $S-2 = 3/7$. Maybe it was $S= s_{outer\_blocks} + d$? The side length of the outer hexagon formed by block vertices is 2. So the distance from center to vertex is 2. So $S = 2 + 3/7 = 17/7$. Why was the area negative?
  $A_{blocks} = 9\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{882\\sqrt{3}}{98}$. $A_{frame} = \\frac{867\\sqrt{3}}{98}$.
  The area of the central hole is $A_{hole} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(1)^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
  The question is asking for the area inside the frame not occupied by blocks. This is the area of the central hole.
  Let's check if my $S=3$ calculation is consistent with $d=3/7$.
  If $S=3$, a vertex of the frame is at $(3,0)$. A block is placed against the side from $(3,0)$ to $(3/2, 3\\sqrt{3}/2)$. Its center would be at $(9/4, 3\\sqrt{3}/4)$. Its vertices...
  A simpler logic must exist. The total area is the area of the frame minus the area of the 6 blocks. This is the area of the central hexagonal hole. Let's find its side length. The figure shows the blocks forming a ring around a central hole. The inner side of each block forms a side of the central hole. So the side length of the hole is 1. The area of the hole is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. None of the answers match this.
  
  The area is area of frame - area of blocks.
  $Area = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}S^2 - 9\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(S^2 - 6)$.
  Let's re-find $S$. The distance from a corner of the frame to the nearest vertex of a block is $3/7$.
  Let the center be the origin. A frame vertex is at $V_F = (S,0)$. The side length of a small hexagon is 1. The blocks are arranged around a central hexagon of side 1. This means the centers of the blocks form a hexagon of side 2. The vertices of this configuration of blocks form an outer hexagon with vertices at distance $\\sqrt{1^2+2^2 - 2(1)(2)cos(120)} = \\sqrt{7}$ from the center? No.
  The distance from the center to a vertex of a block is either 1, $\\sqrt{3}$, or 2. The furthest vertices of the blocks form a hexagon of side 2. The distance from the center to one of these vertices is 2. The distance from center to frame corner is $S$. So $S-2 = 3/7 \\implies S=17/7$.
  Area = $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}( (17/7)^2 - 6) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(\\frac{289}{49} - \\frac{294}{49}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(-\\frac{5}{49})$. Still negative.
  
  The distance $3/7$ must be from the frame corner to the block vertex *along the line from the center*.
  So $S = 2 + 3/7$ is correct. Where did I get area of 6 blocks is 6?
  $A_{blocks} = 6 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 9\\sqrt{3}$.
  $S=17/7$. $A_{frame} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}S^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(\\frac{17}{7})^2 = \\frac{867\\sqrt{3}}{98}$.
  $A_{unoccupied} = A_{frame} - A_{blocks} = \\frac{867\\sqrt{3}}{98} - 9\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{867-882}{98}\\sqrt{3}$. Still negative.
  
  The problem must be that the unoccupied region is not just the hole, but also gaps near the corners. The blocks are shifted inwards from the frame's sides.
  If $S=3$, the area is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(3^2) - 9\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{18\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This is option (C). Let's check if $S=3$ is consistent with $d=3/7$.
  If $S=3$, frame vertex at $(3,0)$. The adjacent block sits on the side whose endpoints are $(3,0)$ and $(1.5, 1.5\\sqrt{3})$. The center of this block is at $(2, \\sqrt{3}/2)$ relative to the side's midpoint? This is too hard.
  Let's try a different model. The side of the large hexagon is $S$. The side of a small hexagon is $s=1$. The blocks are aligned with sides of the frame. Apothem of frame is $A_F = S\\sqrt{3}/2$. Apothem of block is $a_b=\\sqrt{3}/2$.
  The distance from center to a far vertex of a block is 2s=2. The distance from center to a frame corner is $S$. This vertex is distance $d=3/7$ from the frame corner. $S=2+3/7 = 17/7$.
  Area is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} (S^2 - 6) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}( (17/7)^2 - 6) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(\frac{289-294}{49}) < 0$.
  The phrase 'aligned with two other blocks' implies the blocks form straight lines across the frame.
  The long diagonal of the frame is $2S$. This must be equal to the long diagonal of 3 blocks in a line, which is $3 \\times (2s) = 6$. So $2S=6 \\implies S=3$.
  Then Area = $\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This is option C.
  Let's check the $d=3/7$ condition with $S=3$.
  Frame vertex at $(3,0)$. Center of frame at $(0,0)$. Block center could be at $(2,0)$. Its vertices would be $(3,0), (2.5, \\sqrt{3}/2), (1.5, \\sqrt{3}/2), (1,0), (1.5, -\\sqrt{3}/2), (2.5, -\\sqrt{3}/2)$.
  Nearest vertex to $(3,0)$ is not $(3,0)$ itself. Let's say the block is placed differently. The configuration is fixed by the image. The vertices of the blocks nearest a frame corner are the 'outer' vertices. Distance from center to such a vertex is 2. Distance from center to frame corner is $S$. My initial logic must be right, but the calculation is flawed.
  $A_{unoccupied} = A_{frame} - 6 A_{block}$. If $S=3$, $A_{unoccupied} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}(3^2-6) = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
  Let's trust the 'aligned with two other blocks' gives $S=3$.",
