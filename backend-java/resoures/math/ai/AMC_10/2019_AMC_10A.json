            "text": "<p>Let's analyze the counting game. The children, Tadd (A), Todd (B), and Tucker (C), say a sequence of numbers in turns. The number of integers said in turn $k$ is $k$. The cycle of children is A, B, C, A, B, C, ...</p><p>Tadd speaks on turns $k=1, 4, 7, \\dots$, which can be expressed as $k=3j+1$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.</p><p>First, we find which of Tadd's turns contains his 2019th number. Let's calculate the cumulative count of numbers Tadd says.</p><p>The number of integers Tadd says in turn $k=3j+1$ is $3j+1$.</p><p>The total number of integers Tadd has said after his turn corresponding to index $j$ is:</p><p>$S_j = \\sum_{i=0}^{j} (3i+1) = 3\\sum_{i=0}^{j} i + \\sum_{i=0}^{j} 1 = 3\\frac{j(j+1)}{2} + (j+1) = (j+1)\\left(\\frac{3j}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{(j+1)(3j+2)}{2}$.</p><p>We need to find $j$ such that $S_{j-1} < 2019 \\le S_j$. Let's estimate $j$: $\\frac{3j^2}{2} \\approx 2019 \\implies j^2 \\approx \\frac{4038}{3} = 1346$. Since $30^2=900$ and $40^2=1600$, $j$ is between 30 and 40. $\\sqrt{1346} \\approx 36.7$. Let's test $j=36$.</p><p>$S_{36} = \\frac{(36+1)(3 \\cdot 36+2)}{2} = \\frac{37 \\cdot 110}{2} = 37 \\cdot 55 = 2035$.</p><p>Let's test $j=35$.</p><p>$S_{35} = \\frac{(35+1)(3 \\cdot 35+2)}{2} = \\frac{36 \\cdot 107}{2} = 18 \\cdot 107 = 1926$.</p><p>Since $1926 < 2019 \\le 2035$, Tadd's 2019th number is said during his turn corresponding to $j=36$. This is turn $k = 3(36)+1 = 109$.</p><p>The first $1926$ numbers Tadd said were in turns up to $j=35$. We are looking for the $(2019 - 1926 = 93)$-rd number that Tadd says during turn 109.</p><p>To find what this number is, we need to know what number the turn starts with. Turn 109 starts after the last number of turn 108. The last number said in turn $k$ is the total sum of integers said, which is $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.</p><p>Last number of turn 108 is $N_{108} = \\frac{108(109)}{2} = 54 \\times 109 = 5886$.</p><p>So, turn 109 starts with the number 5887. Tadd says the numbers $5887, 5888, \\dots$. The 93rd number he says in this turn is:</p><p>$5886 + 93 = 5979$.</p>",
