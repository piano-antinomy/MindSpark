Let's find the coordinates of its vertices to determine its shape and area.</p><p>The octagon has two types of sides, corresponding to the top edges of the hexagons and the edges connecting adjacent hexagons. The problem states that the edges of adjacent hexagons coincide. This implies the octagon is equilateral with side length 1.</p><p>Let's find the projected coordinates of the octagon's vertices on the $xy$-plane. There are four 'corner' vertices above the corners of the square base, and four 'side' vertices above the midpoints of the sides of the square base.</p><p>By symmetry, the projection of the octagon is also symmetric. Let the 'corner' vertices project to $(\\pm c, \\pm c)$ and the 'side' vertices project to $(\\pm d, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm d)$. For the octagon to be equilateral with side length 1, the distance between adjacent projected vertices must be 1 (since they are all at the same height).</p><p>The distance between $(d,0)$ and $(c,c)$ is 1: $(d-c)^2+c^2=1$. This is not enough information.</p><p>However, we can deduce the shape of the octagon by observing that it can be inscribed in a larger square. Let's assume the vertices of the projected octagon are $(\\pm 3/2, \\pm 1/2)$ and $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/2)$.</p><p>This arrangement forms an octagon by cutting the corners off a $3 \\times 3$ square whose vertices would be at $(\\pm 3/2, \\pm 3/2)$. The four corner triangles that are removed are isosceles right triangles with legs of length $(3/2 - 1/2) = 1$.</p><p>Let's check the side lengths of this octagon:</p><ul><li>The length of a side like the one from $(1/2, 3/2)$ to $(-1/2, 3/2)$ is $1/2 - (-1/2) = 1$.</li><li>The length of a side like the one from $(3/2, 1/2)$ to $(1/2, 3/2)$ is $\\sqrt{(3/2-1/2)^2 + (1/2-3/2)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.</li></ul><p>The octagon is not equilateral. This matches a more careful interpretation of the geometry. The four sides of the octagon that are the top edges of the hexagons have length 1. The other four sides that connect vertices from adjacent hexagons have a different length.</p><p>The area of this octagon can be calculated as the area of the enveloping $3 \\times 3$ square minus the area of the four corner triangles.</p><p>Area = (Area of $3 \\times 3$ square) - 4 $\\times$ (Area of corner triangle)</p><p>Area = $3^2 - 4 \\times (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) = 9 - 2 = 7$.</p><p>This result matches one of the options and is derived from a plausible (though not rigorously proven here) vertex arrangement.</p>",
