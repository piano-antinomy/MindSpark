Since $d>1$, let's test integer values for $d$. If $d=2$, $a+12=17 \\implies a=5$. This gives a valid sequence with $a=5, d=2, n=13$. All conditions are met. For this solution, $a+d+n = 5+2+13=20$.</li><li>If $n=17$: $17(2a+16d) = 442 \\implies 2a+16d = 26 \\implies a+8d = 13$. If $d=2$, $a+16=13 \\implies a=-3$. This is a valid sequence. For this solution, $a+d+n = -3+2+17=16$, which is not an option. If $d=1$, not allowed. If $d \ge 2$, then $8d \ge 16$, so $a = 13-8d$ would be negative.</li><li>Other integer factors of 442 (like 26, 34, etc.) can be checked, but they don't yield solutions satisfying $d>1$. For example, if $n=26$, $2a+25d=17$. For $d>1$, $25d > 25$, so $2a$ must be negative and large, but $17-25d$ is not even if $d$ is odd, and if $d$ is even, $17-25d$ is odd. No integer solution for $a$.</li></ul><p><b>Case 2: The correct sum is $S_n = 223$.</b></p><p>$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d) = 223$.</p><p>$n(2a + (n-1)d) = 446$.</p><p>The number 223 is prime. The factorization of 446 is $2 \\times 223$. Since $n \\ge 3$, the only possibility is $n=223$.</p><p>If $n=223$: $223(2a+222d) = 446 \\implies 2a+222d=2 \\implies a+111d=1$. Since $d>1$, $111d > 111$. This means $a$ must be large and negative ($a=1-111d$), but this doesn't lead to a unique answer for $a+d+n$. The problem's phrasing implies a unique answer, suggesting integer constraints lead to a unique solution set.</p><p>The only viable solution that matches the answer choices is from Case 1, where $(a,d,n)=(5,2,13)$.</p><p>The value of $a+d+n$ is $5+2+13 = 20$.</p>",
