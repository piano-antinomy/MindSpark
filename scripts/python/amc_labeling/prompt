update the ones you agree, but you can only use the official categories

} 

those are the official categories and subcategories, you are only allowed to use those to categorize math problems. Do not use any other categories


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


tell me which categorization you disagree with, and what is your proposed new categorization
you can only choose the categories i provided earlier on; also you should list the problem id when you show your disagreement

don't give me the ones you agree, we focus on disagree ones.
