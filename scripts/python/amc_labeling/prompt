those are the official categories and subcategories, you are only allowed to use those to categorize math problems. Do not use any other categories


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


tell me which categorization you disagree with, and what is your proposed new categorization
you can only choose the categories i provided earlier on; also you should list the problem id when you show your disagreement

don't give me the ones you agree, we focus on disagree ones. 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~`


those are reviewer's opion about the current categorization, do you agree?

read the actual problems, questions and solutions, you can find the problem id in the text

Here are the problem IDs along with the proposed new categories:


Problem ID: amc_2025_8_5
Current Categorization: geometry, general
Proposed Categorization: geometry, coordinate_geometry
Reason: The problem involves finding a path that follows a grid-like system and calculating total distance within this system, aligning more closely with concepts of coordinate geometry.
Problem ID: amc_2025_8_21
Current Categorization: logic, general
Proposed Categorization: combinatorics, graph_theory
Reason: This problem involves understanding the connections between pods (nodes) with specific constraints on differences, making it related to graph theory in combinatorics.
Problem ID: amc_2025_8_24
Current Categorization: geometry, triangles
Proposed Categorization: geometry, polygons
Reason: The problem focuses on a trapezoid which, although related to triangles, is primarily a problem concerning properties of polygons, especially quadrilaterals.
Problem ID: amc_2025_8_25
Current Categorization: combinatorics, counting
Proposed Categorization: geometry, general
Reason: The problem focuses on calculating areas determined by paths on a diamond grid, involving more geometric reasoning alongside the combinatorial concepts, thus better fitting under a general geometry category.
