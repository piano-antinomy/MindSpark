The maximum with 4 coins is 4 quarters = 100¢, so this is possible. But can we make 15¢ with exactly 4 coins? The smallest 4 coins would be 4 pennies = 4¢, which is too small. We need to use some larger coins. Let's try: 1 nickel + 3 pennies = 5 + 3 = 8¢ (too small), 2 nickels + 2 pennies = 10 + 2 = 12¢ (too small), 3 nickels + 1 penny = 15 + 1 = 16¢ (too large).

We cannot make exactly 25¢ with 4 coins either.</p><p>Wait, let me reconsider. The problem asks which total value could NOT be made. Let me check more carefully:</p><p>A) 15¢: Can we make 15¢ with exactly 4 coins? 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15¢, but that's only 2 coins. We need 4 coins. 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17¢ (too large). 3 nickels = 15¢, but that's only 3 coins. We cannot make exactly 15¢ with 4 coins.</p><p>B) 25¢: 1 quarter = 25¢, but we need 4 coins. 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 28¢ (too large). 5 nickels = 25¢, but we need exactly 4 coins. 4 nickels + 1 penny = 21¢ (too small).

Wait, 3 dimes + 1 nickel = 30 + 5 = 35¢ with exactly 4 coins. This is possible.</p><p>D) 45¢: 1 quarter + 2 dimes = 25 + 20 = 45¢, but that's only 3 coins. 1 quarter + 2 dimes + 1 penny = 46¢ (too large). 4 dimes + 1 nickel = 40 + 5 = 45¢, but that's 5 coins.
